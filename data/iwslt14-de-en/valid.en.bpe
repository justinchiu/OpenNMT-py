it &apos;s that pyramid .
in mother &apos;s milk .
it had two-@@ to-@@ three-@@ to-@@ 400 times the toxic lo@@ ads ever allowed by the ep@@ a .
often what j@@ ams us up is se@@ wa@@ ge .
what do you do when you have this sort of dis@@ rup@@ ted flow ?
stephen pal@@ um@@ bi : following the mer@@ cur@@ y tra@@ il
i really thought they were so bene@@ ath me .
but we didn &apos;t realize at the time that we actually needed a third mani@@ pul@@ ator , because we couldn &apos;t manipu@@ late the ne@@ ck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
and now we would like to introduce you to jo@@ ey .
b@@ j : and mi@@ key also has , in his fingers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
mi@@ key bre@@ tt , craig , leo , z@@ em jo@@ aqu@@ in and bas@@ il and me .
in winter , there &apos;s a lot of sle@@ eping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
the thing to watch for as a global philanthrop@@ y industry comes about -- and that &apos;s exactly what is happening -- is how the as@@ pi@@ ration is to flip these old assu@@ mp@@ tions , for philanthrop@@ y to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off .
i &apos;m going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categ@@ ories , which are innovation , competi@@ tions and social invest@@ ing .
it may be that the social sing@@ ul@@ arity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a conver@@ gence of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , of environmental degra@@ dation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pande@@ mi@@ cs , of poverty .
i believe that there are new , hidden ten@@ sions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people in@@ hab@@ it in their daily life : schools , hospitals , work@@ places , fac@@ tories , off@@ ices , etc .
the first gentle@@ man , he &apos;s a bak@@ er .
so , think of the three sett@@ ings i &apos;ve talked to you about : factory , migration , office .
they were living on top of the work@@ shops where they were working .
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn &apos;t have been driving ?
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first autonom@@ ously dri@@ f@@ ting car .
now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of electro@@ des on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
watch the mental work@@ load , and watch the ste@@ ering .
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn &apos;t move out of their neighbor@@ hoods .
so a few years ago , l.a. county decided that they needed to spend 2.@@ 5 billion dollars to repair the city schools .
i mean , literally , her home@@ town is called whit@@ es@@ ville , west virginia .
so these three guys all understand how to produ@@ ctively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market dem@@ ands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
our m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ alities , rural and urban , play the oper@@ ational course of infrastructure -- things like waste dis@@ pos@@ al , energy demand , as well as social costs of un@@ emplo@@ yment , dro@@ p-@@ out rates , in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates and the impac@@ ts of various public health costs .
and reading that book made me re@@ exam@@ ine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
and i think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
i went to dea@@ f clu@@ bs .
and yet , we have nobody who is trying to en@@ sure that the next generation of children born to afri@@ can@@ -@@ americans and asi@@ ans come out with cre@@ amy skin and yellow hair .
and he ended up achie@@ ving at a level that had never before been con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated by any member of his family .
the experience of down syndro@@ me people includes those who are actors , those who are writers , some who are able to live fully indepen@@ d@@ ently in adul@@ tho@@ od .
and a lot of the time the question of par@@ en@@ tho@@ od is , what do we v@@ ali@@ date in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test fl@@ am@@ e-@@ re@@ tar@@ d@@ ant pa@@ jam@@ as in an in@@ fer@@ no to en@@ sure they won &apos;t catch fire when our child reach@@ es across the sto@@ ve , so these stories of families negoti@@ ating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of par@@ enting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indi@@ cate hydro@@ cep@@ hal@@ us .
and i came from a very privi@@ le@@ ged background . i was very lucky .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be su@@ ed for it .
the point being , this is going to be very , very intensive on the progra@@ mming side .
you want a separate thing , like the a@@ c adap@@ tor .
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
not something you &apos;d en@@ vy or want to do .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i pal@@ p@@ ably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
so actually now on this website , we have 18@@ ,000 people .
and we &apos;re building upon innovations of generations who went before us .
but remember , gre@@ e@@ ce is there today .
and when you think about the economy through these two different len@@ ses , you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve , because the worse the crisis gets , the higher the sta@@ kes are , the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ru@@ in everything .
that &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , and that pres@@ ents a more difficult issue .
the phrase that you want , if you &apos;re a graduate student or a post@@ do@@ c or you &apos;re a professor , a 3@@ 8@@ -year-old economics professor , is , &quot; i &apos;m an em@@ pi@@ ri@@ cist .
we know what it &apos;s like to have these people on tv , in congress , y@@ elling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t adop@@ t their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar .
and he said to the guy , &quot; why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot;
i thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
the wir@@ ing from your sensory appar@@ at@@ us to those bits is shor@@ ter than the bits that have to pass through the thin@@ ky bit , the cortex .
where are you feeling this ?
and also tri@@ um@@ ph , this sense of tran@@ scen@@ dence , this &quot; i never knew that . ah , this is something new . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly ex@@ pose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
and then i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to do that radi@@ ator , which is cur@@ ved .
no one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzy@@ mes , of these trig@@ gers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this .
now i think it &apos;s too easy .
we have se@@ cul@@ ari@@ zed bad@@ ly , i would argue .
we need data , we don &apos;t need help .
you need to keep repe@@ ating the lesson 10 times a day .
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up ritu@@ als around important feelings .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
but that feeling of puzz@@ le@@ ment is struc@@ tural to contemporary art .
the people in the modern world , in the se@@ cular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher sou@@ l-@@ like concern@@ s , tend to be isol@@ ated individuals .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
and i say , &quot; of course . &quot; and they say , &quot; so aren &apos;t you sort of religious ? &quot;
because you &apos;ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you poli@@ tely diff@@ er .
so it took me from places like chile -- the at@@ ac@@ ama desert in chile -- to si@@ ber@@ ia , to underground min@@ es in the japanese al@@ ps , in northern america , all the way to ant@@ arc@@ tica and even to the south pole .
you need something like tens of me@@ gat@@ ons of water -- almost a gi@@ gat@@ on of water -- in order to have any chance of cat@@ ching this neu@@ trin@@ o .
the toi@@ lets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a woo@@ den sha@@ ck .
so this is us land@@ ing on the ross ice shel@@ f in ant@@ arc@@ tica .
the fabric alone weigh@@ s two tons .
an@@ il an@@ anth@@ as@@ w@@ amy : what it takes to do extreme astro@@ physics
well , first you have to , as an engineer , scop@@ e the problem . how big is it ?
and a boo@@ k@@ mobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish , a prin@@ ter , bin@@ der and cu@@ tter , and kids make their own books .
we have one of these things now . it &apos;s completely cool .
but we sent -- thought , ok , if we &apos;re going to need to do this , let &apos;s do it in-@@ library .
the ge@@ tty here is moving their books to the u@@ cl@@ a , which is where we have one these scan@@ ning centers , and scan@@ ning their out@@ -@@ of-@@ copyright books , which is fabulous .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a dis@@ k and put it online , if you &apos;re doing things in volume .
we ten@@ ded towards lon@@ ger-@@ term things and also things that people can re@@ use and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
so anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of where things came from .
so en@@ vision what it looks like all wra@@ pped up .
it looked more like this when it was all wra@@ pped up -- not quite so pretty .
and frankly , i face a big obstac@@ le .
but these are essentially ex@@ tern@@ alized sto@@ ma@@ chs and l@@ ungs .
so , f@@ ung@@ i and my@@ ce@@ li@@ um sequ@@ e@@ ster carbon dioxide in the form of cal@@ ci@@ um ox@@ al@@ ates .
the my@@ ce@@ li@@ um , in the right conditions , produces a mush@@ room -- it bur@@ sts through with such fer@@ o@@ city that it can break as@@ p@@ halt .
and i &apos;ll show you a graph here .
there &apos;s a v@@ et@@ ted press release that you can read -- it &apos;s v@@ et@@ ted by do@@ d -- if you google &quot; stam@@ ets &quot; and &quot; smallpox . &quot;
so , the house is no longer su@@ itable for invasi@@ on .
too many with@@ dra@@ w@@ als from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shut down .
so we had our own mini@@ ature rain@@ forest , a private beach with a coral reef .
so eight of us went in : four men and four women .
we stopped irri@@ g@@ ating our soil , as much as we could .
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really cr@@ ank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
i had been growing all my own food .
and all of it was coming from this : shrimp far@@ ms .
it &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot;
and if you lose where you are in your bio@@ sphere , or are perhaps having a difficul@@ ty connecting with where you are in the bio@@ sphere , i would say to you , take a deep breath .
the cause of our trou@@ bles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
we have now found treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
there &apos;s another sign that we need p@@ it cre@@ ws , and that &apos;s the un@@ mana@@ ge@@ able cost of our care .
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
we got the lead safety engineer for bo@@ eing to help us .
there &apos;s a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to con@@ front that we &apos;re not a system , forces us to behave with a different set of values .
and most of those los@@ ses are because of things we know .
if you don &apos;t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-@@ pound packa@@ ge of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the post@@ al office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-@@ pound pack@@ ages of bees .
but if you &apos;re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your col@@ onies , you can &apos;t survive three years in a row . and we &apos;re really worried about losing this se@@ gment of our industry .
and bees are very fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful .
and of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
but i also want to rein@@ force some of the ideas we &apos;ve heard here , because having a me@@ a@@ dow or living by a me@@ a@@ dow is transforma@@ tional .
well actually , i &apos;ve &#91; been &#93; whist@@ ling since the age of four , about four .
i lost my face .
and i want to first re@@ hear@@ se with you your whist@@ ling .
some of them are very easy .
and they also are able to show and to exhi@@ bit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
look at this young be@@ an that is moving to catch the light every time .
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?
and why are they so similar ?
thank you .
they &apos;re going to be enter@@ ing this car one by one .
and also in 50 other cities around the world , people particip@@ ated .
and because it was in union square park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
they &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
he gave 2,000 high fi@@ ves that day , and he wash@@ ed his hands before and after@@ ward and did not get sick .
and not knowing where help was needed always en@@ su@@ red that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
our goal over the next year is to get water can@@ ary ready for the field and to open-source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evalu@@ ation , so we can t@@ ack@@ le this problem together .
now why am i talking about co@@ ws ?
so what i &apos;m pro@@ posing is , just as we require reading , writing , arith@@ me@@ tic , american history , so we should have a curricul@@ um on facts about all the religions of the world -- about their history , about their cre@@ eds , about their texts , their music , their symboli@@ sms , their pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions , their requi@@ rements .
all i &apos;m saying is -- facts . facts only .
except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the sheep &apos;s cle@@ vern@@ ess .
the lesson we learn from this is you don &apos;t have to have a mind to be a bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ary .
and how can we do that ?
i &apos;m talking also about chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity .
yes .
but i wish it were better .
and here i think , &quot; wait a minute . &quot;
well , this from &quot; the purpose driven life &quot; -- &quot; the bible must become the auth@@ or@@ it@@ ative standard for my life , the comp@@ ass i rely on for direction , the coun@@ sel i listen to for making wise decisions and the ben@@ ch@@ mark i use for evalu@@ ating everything . &quot;
now do we really want to com@@ mit ourselves to eng@@ ul@@ fing all the other religions when their hol@@ y books are telling them , &quot; don &apos;t listen to the other side , that &apos;s just sat@@ an talking ! &quot;
ears are made not for hearing , but for listening .
it looks a bit like this .
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it &apos;s too loud .
first of all , listen consciously .
and my relationship to especially human@@ -@@ made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit .
so kids don &apos;t have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
and then you can take the little piano circuit off the pen@@ cil .
and so we &apos;re like , &quot; we got@@ ta put a video out about this . &quot;
okay , just wait for this one . this is good .
it &apos;s really going to be seven billion pa@@ irs of hands , each following their own passi@@ ons , and each kind of like a mo@@ sa@@ ic coming up and creating this world in their back@@ y@@ ards and in their kit@@ chens .
but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical od@@ di@@ ty .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rock@@ ets and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , anymore than light can escape .
this is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer mod@@ eling .
and surely , somewhere in the universe two black holes have mer@@ ged .
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habit@@ able planet .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multi@@ verse , in some other pat@@ ch of that multi@@ verse , are there creatures ?
of the 100 in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated people that are released , 60 will return to prison .
well , it has its pl@@ uses and min@@ uses .
from the fact that they are only ser@@ ving one audience , mainly the western culture .
i go everywhere to make believe it &apos;s iran .
now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009 , as my film is released -- the u@@ pris@@ ing begins in the streets of te@@ hr@@ an .
it can &apos;t afford to doubt the person who ten@@ ds the child .
one person w@@ ins .
i will come to it later .
you cannot comm@@ and compassion unless you become limit@@ less , and nobody can become limit@@ less , either you are or you are not . period .
you act com@@ passion@@ ately .
if this does not blow your mind , then you have no emotion .
and let &apos;s pause here .
it &apos;s good for motiv@@ ated students .
in a traditional classroom , you have a couple of home@@ work , home@@ work , lecture , home@@ work , lecture , and then you have a s@@ nap@@ shot ex@@ am .
and you can go to the site right now . it &apos;s all free . not trying to sell anything .
red means they &apos;re stuck .
and we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rock@@ star team doing the software .
and they &apos;re literally saying , &quot; hey , this is nice , but ... &quot; like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , &quot; i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jum@@ ping around and not focusing on one topic . &quot;
but there are also hallu@@ cin@@ ations as well , and hallu@@ cin@@ ations are completely different .
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down stairs .
i said , &quot; there is a special form of visual hallu@@ cin@@ ation which may go with de@@ teri@@ or@@ ating vision or blin@@ dness .
the first thing he said was he saw a hand@@ ker@@ chief in mi@@ da@@ ir .
and he turned around . and then he divided into six figures in stri@@ ped shir@@ ts , who started walking towards her .
but no more than one percent of the people ac@@ knowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as in@@ san@@ e or something .
when people have these simple ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal hallu@@ cin@@ ations , the primary visual cortex is activ@@ ated .
it is only if one is visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red or blind that the process is inter@@ rup@@ ted .
and actually i &apos;m a little visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red myself .
but i would come back from those di@@ ves and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate to the task .
it &apos;s unbelie@@ vable .
this looks like something out of a dr. se@@ uss book -- just all man@@ ner of creatures all over this thing .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called eye@@ -@@ in-@@ the-@@ sea that uses far red light that &apos;s invisible to most animals , so it &apos;s un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jell@@ yfish .
edi@@ th wid@@ der : the weird , wonderful world of biolumines@@ cence
the yel@@ low-@@ green area is the flu@@ ids of blood , which is mostly water , but it &apos;s also anti@@ bodies , sug@@ ars , hor@@ mon@@ es , that kind of thing .
it &apos;s an accurate repres@@ entation , and it &apos;s pretty much at the correct speed for what is oc@@ curr@@ ing inside you .
one set of dna goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of dna -- identical cop@@ ies of dna .
it &apos;s able to feel when the cell is ready , when the chromo@@ some is correc@@ tly posi@@ tioned .
humanity is now fully into the tech@@ no-@@ scientific age .
during 4@@ 1 years of teaching biology at harvard , i watched sa@@ dly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-@@ required cour@@ ses in science because they were afraid of failure .
judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand .
or larger , what &apos;s the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe ?
humans have lived for much , much longer than the appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 10,000 years of sett@@ led agricultural civilization in small family groups . no@@ ma@@ dic h@@ unter@@ s bring down rab@@ bits , gathering food .
more recently , that power is un@@ te@@ ther@@ ing and le@@ ap@@ ing off the des@@ k@@ tops , and very , very quickly , we &apos;re going to see a significant propor@@ tion , if not the majority of the human race , walking around holding , carrying or wearing super@@ computers linked at spee@@ ds greater than what we consider to be broad@@ band today .
he used the example of a common gra@@ zing area in which each person by simply ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing their own flo@@ ck led to over@@ gra@@ zing and the de@@ ple@@ tion of the resource .

and if you remember the story about s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us , s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us was pun@@ ished by the go@@ ds to push the same rock up a hill , and when he almost got to the end , the rock would roll over , and he would have to start again .
what happened ?
i said , &quot; how many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? &quot;
so you take a piece , you just put it on the side .
the next part i want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
you had to measure the milk and add it , mix@@ ing it .
at the top of the sheet , we had little diagra@@ ms of how do you fold origami .
by the way , these are my kids , which , of course , are wonderful and so on .
and we &apos;re actually cam@@ bo@@ di@@ ans .
this is a picture of what pur@@ sat looks like .
but for us it meant freedom .
one day a man told me , &quot; my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . &quot;
so the key here is empathy .
we re@@ vis@@ ed the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho@@ -@@ social care and psycho@@ -@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ors to the system .
when jun@@ gi@@ an analy@@ st inge miss@@ ma@@ hl visited afghanistan , she saw the inner wo@@ unds of war -- wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad des@@ pair , trau@@ ma and depression . and yet , in this county of 30 million people , there were only two dozen psychi@@ atri@@ sts . miss@@ ma@@ hl talks about her work helping to build the country &apos;s system of psycho@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ing , pro@@ mot@@ ing both individual and , perhaps , national heal@@ ing .
that &apos;s true of european bio@@ fuels .
top left , we have canada and australia , with enormous land areas , very high per capita consumption , 200 or 300 light bul@@ bs per person , and very low population den@@ si@@ ties .
wind power produces a bit more , 2.@@ 5 watts per square meter , but that &apos;s only twice as big as 1.@@ 25 watts per square meter , so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind far@@ ms , you need wind far@@ ms half the area of the u.k.
but the same goes for renew@@ ables as well .
next , there &apos;s the he@@ ating le@@ ver .
so , if you wanted to get 16 light bul@@ bs , remember , today our total energy consumption is 1@@ 25 light bul@@ bs &apos; worth .

from the minute a child &apos;s taught how to play an instrument , he &apos;s no longer poor .
think about it , all right ? i &apos;m going to answer the phone three different times .
behavioral mark@@ ers matter .
that actually occurred this year . she took early reti@@ rement .
we are obsessed with this way of thinking .
classic . hip fra@@ c@@ ture often leads to institu@@ tion@@ alization of a senior .
these discoveries of behavioral mark@@ ers , and behavioral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data stre@@ ams that we &apos;ve actually never done before .
it &apos;s achie@@ vable . we should do it econom@@ ically , we should do it mor@@ ally , and we should do it for quality of life .
we will see 3@@ 0,000 new infected websites .
this is the market leader in mal@@ ware distribution , the black hole explo@@ it pack , responsible for nearly one third of mal@@ ware distribution in the last couple of quarters .
so this is writing out the mali@@ cious code , and a few seconds later , on the left-@@ hand side , you &apos;ll see the attac@@ ker &apos;s screen get some interesting new text .
what &apos;s really insu@@ l@@ ting about this is not only does it provide the attac@@ kers with access to your data , but when the scan fin@@ ish@@ es , they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses , you have to regi@@ ster the product .
a little more searching , and here &apos;s our cyber@@ crimin@@ al .
okay ? so you can see a list of wireless networks .
you see , technology &apos;s changing at a stag@@ gering rate , and that 25@@ 0,000 pieces of mal@@ ware won &apos;t stay the same for long .
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things .
you all know the story , right .
and that was really cool .
it was extraordinary .
&quot; you can call it a dinosaur , but look at the vel@@ o@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor : the vel@@ o@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor is cool . &quot;
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
and so he agreed .
and quite frankly , i think if col@@ on@@ el s@@ anders was to be careful how he wor@@ ded it , he could actually adverti@@ se an extra piece .
that &apos;s based on diet in@@ take sur@@ ve@@ ys , it &apos;s based on levels of obesity , it &apos;s based on a range of factors that gives you an appro@@ x@@ ima@@ te guess as to how much food is actually going into people &apos;s mou@@ ths .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year .
go one step up , and you get to farmers , who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harv@@ est because of cos@@ me@@ tic standards .
the one in the middle , on my kitchen table . not much difference .
western countries throw out nearly half of their food , not because it &apos;s ine@@ di@@ ble -- but because it doesn &apos;t look appe@@ aling . tri@@ stra@@ m stu@@ art del@@ ves into the sho@@ cking data of wa@@ sted food , calling for a more responsible use of global resources .
and this is all done , by the way , by the international astronom@@ ical union .
now , we &apos;re going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it &apos;s going to be un@@ fair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names .
&quot; listen , i &apos;m going back to the sw@@ amp mer@@ ma@@ id . can you call me in a little while ? &quot;

they have an in@@ formed opinion , but it &apos;s changing so quickly that even the experts don &apos;t know exactly what &apos;s going on .
if you have followed diplo@@ matic news in the past weeks , you may have heard of a kind of crisis between china and the u.s.
the first issue : imagine a potential enemy announ@@ cing they &apos;re building a cyber@@ war unit , but only for their country &apos;s defense .
and this coordin@@ ation may become even trick@@ ier with the introdu@@ ction of cy@@ ber weapons .
it &apos;s just a big blue surface .
so if you ever fan@@ t@@ asi@@ ze about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like , that &apos;s what a dinosaur looks like .
he can &apos;t spin a web any@@ time ; he &apos;s got to pull his pants down first .
he never seems to se@@ ttle on any particular girl .
so what i did was i made an ad@@ venture stri@@ p .
this is what i love about com@@ ic stri@@ ps , you know .
and you hear other people doing the same thing .
in the nor@@ th@@ west quad@@ rant of british colum@@ bia , an area of land the size of or@@ eg@@ on , there &apos;s one road , a nar@@ row ri@@ bb@@ on of as@@ p@@ halt that sli@@ ps up the side of the coast mountains to the yu@@ k@@ on .
our goal is not only to help them do that but to encourage our friends , the good people at shell , not only to with@@ draw from the sacred head@@ wat@@ ers , but to move forward with us and join us as we do the remarkable , the extraordinary : set aside a protected area that will be for all time not simply the sacred head@@ wat@@ ers of the ta@@ hl@@ tan people but the sacred head@@ wat@@ ers of all people in the world .
5@@ 9@@ 4 . let &apos;s give three of them a nice round of appl@@ ause there .
3@@ 4@@ 8@@ 1 .
is that 5@@ 13@@ ,@@ 2@@ 8@@ 4 ?
would you each enter that on your calcul@@ ator ?
2@@ 6@@ 3@@ 9@@ 72 .
six@@ th -- was that a fri@@ day ? audience : yes .
18@@ 24 , ok .
audience : three . three .
7@@ 7@@ ,@@ 8@@ 6@@ 2 becomes coo@@ k@@ ie fis@@ sion , coo@@ k@@ ie fis@@ sion is 7@@ 7@@ ,@@ 8@@ 22 .
nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious stat@@ ements from my first book , &quot; silicon sna@@ ke oil , &quot; or my second book , nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don &apos;t bel@@ ong in schools .
i &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but i want to talk about what i &apos;m doing now . what am i doing now ?
and i looked over her albu@@ m and she had collected a picture of me , standing -- well , sitting -- in 196@@ 9 , in front of a bunch of di@@ als .
kids . kids is what i &apos;m going to talk about -- is that okay ?
and that &apos;s one of the things i thought i &apos;d do right now .
all i need now is to flip on another be@@ am , and the bottom be@@ am is me talking , right ?
there &apos;s a ri@@ ot going on on campus , and the police are ch@@ asing me , right ?
i &apos;m looking out and i &apos;m seeing the cop@@ s bas@@ hing students &apos; heads , shooting te@@ ar gas , and watching students thro@@ wing bri@@ cks .
whatever it was for you , i bet that , among other things , this gave you a little more freedom , a little more time .
we want things that are designed for how they &apos;re used the vast majority of the time , not that rare event .
thank you .
and they begin an incredible bal@@ let .
and so now i &apos;m going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play , but it &apos;s never just sing@@ ularly one thing .
if you want to bel@@ ong , you need social play .
nothing lights up the brain like play .
and the thing that &apos;s so unique about our species is that we &apos;re really designed to play through our whole lifetime .
and his life -- the transformation of his life from depri@@ vation and what one would expect -- potentially prison or death -- he become a lingu@@ ist , a train@@ er for the 7@@ 6@@ ers and now is a mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tional speaker .
atten@@ de@@ es at meetings don &apos;t know when they &apos;ll get back to the task that they left at their desk .
jh : how do you keep -- and i know you &apos;re part of the scientific research community , and you have to justi@@ fy your existence with gr@@ ants and pro@@ pos@@ als like everyone else -- how do you prevent -- and some of the data that you &apos;ve produced , the good science that you &apos;re talking about you &apos;ve produced , is hot to handle .
h@@ c : and here &apos;s something we have no reference to eat . this is a ci@@ gar , and basically it &apos;s a cu@@ ban ci@@ gar made out of a cu@@ ban por@@ k sandwich , so we take these sp@@ ices that go into the por@@ k shoulder , we fashion that into ash . we take the sandwich and wra@@ p it up in a coll@@ ard green , put an edi@@ ble lab@@ el that be@@ ars no simil@@ arity to a co@@ hi@@ ba ci@@ gar lab@@ el , and we put it in a dollar nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine ash@@ tra@@ y and charge you about tw@@ enty bucks for it .
so repli@@ cating food , taking it into that next level is where we &apos;re going .
this dis@@ rup@@ tive ment@@ ality of what food is would essentially open up the en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia of what raw ingredients are , even if we just swa@@ pped out , say , one of these for fl@@ our , that would elimin@@ ate so much energy and so much waste .
aside from one-@@ person ab@@ c mini@@ -@@ bure@@ aus in nai@@ rob@@ i , new delhi and mumbai , there are no network news bure@@ aus in all of africa , india or south america -- places that are home to more than two billion people .
so , from both directions , there is kind of , i think , a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day , or her own day , which i think artists are ob@@ li@@ ged to do , is to really explore the expres@@ sive potential of the new tools that we have .
as he says here , most people answer without any h@@ es@@ itation .
and then a bunch of people who were like , &quot; what &apos;s the big deal ?
and what you &apos;re typ@@ ing are recor@@ dings of your eyes as you &apos;re looking at other peop@@ les &apos; eyes .
it &apos;s always kind of doing a double take : &quot; what ? &quot;
in fact , this is not unique to hiv . the vast majority of viruses come from animals .
they &apos;re searching for bush meat ; forest animals they can kill to feed their families .
but they &apos;re also going to ask you probably a different question .
when we would get to these rural villages , though , what we found out is that no one had television , so they wouldn &apos;t recognize his face .
need@@ less to say in the past these viruses enter@@ ing into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct .
we were also playing with sms at the time at o@@ de@@ o , so we kind of put two and two together , and in early 2006 we launched twitter as a side project at o@@ de@@ o .
the president himself is our most popular twitter user , although his t@@ wee@@ ts have dropped off as of late , while sen@@ ator mc@@ ca@@ in &apos;s have picked up .
i have no idea what will happen next with twitter .
i was also an early writer , and when i began to write , at about the age of seven , stories in pen@@ cil with cra@@ y@@ on illu@@ stra@@ tions that my poor mother was ob@@ li@@ g@@ ated to read , i wrote exactly the kinds of stories i was reading : all my characters were white and blu@@ e-@@ e@@ yed , they played in the snow , they ate ap@@ ples , how lovely it was that the sun had come out .
so the year i turned eight we got a new house boy .
never mind that i knew nothing about places like nam@@ i@@ bia .
there were end@@ less stories of mexic@@ ans as people who were fle@@ ec@@ ing the healthcare system , s@@ ne@@ a@@ king across the border , being ar@@ re@@ sted at the border , that sort of thing .
but i also had grand@@ fathers who died in refuge@@ e cam@@ ps .
shor@@ tly after he published my first novel i went to a tv station in la@@ gos to do an interview , and a woman who worked there as a messen@@ ger came up to me and said , &quot; i really liked your novel . i didn &apos;t like the ending .
thank you .
but experts do get things wrong .
this doesn &apos;t mean having to get a ph.@@ d.
but just imagine if we were to jun@@ k this notion of expertise as some sort of elite c@@ ad@@ re and instead embrace the notion of democra@@ ti@@ zed expertise -- where@@ by expertise was not just the preser@@ ve of surge@@ ons and ce@@ o &apos;s , but also sh@@ op@@ -@@ girls -- yeah .
i &apos;m eating right , i &apos;m exer@@ cis@@ ing every day , i &apos;m keeping my mind active , that &apos;s what the research says you should do .
i &apos;ve always liked to draw , so i &apos;m doing it more even though i &apos;m really very bad at it .
so how would you run a whole country without oil ?
if you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon the rati@@ o of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute .
you have the cru@@ de oil .
now even if we get to 40 miles per gall@@ on by 20@@ 20 , which is our desire .
we went to other countries . as i said we went to den@@ mark .
and the most fascinating thing we &apos;ve learned is that , when you have small problems on the individual level , like the price of gas@@ ol@@ ine to drive every morning .
and that &apos;s the difference between problems that are addi@@ tive , like co2 , which we go slowly up and then we tip , and problems that are de@@ ple@@ tive , in which we lose what we have , which o@@ sc@@ il@@ late , and they o@@ sc@@ il@@ late until we lose everything we &apos;ve got .
they basically looked at it and said , &quot; car 1.@@ 0 we &apos;ll solve everything within the car itself . &quot;
the two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil -- and scale it infin@@ ity .
we need to have pres@@ identi@@ al leadership just like we had in israel that said we will end oil .
teach your children evolution in biology class , and they &apos;ll soon move on to drugs , grand lar@@ cen@@ y and sexual pre-@@ version .
essentially , it does it by providing a smo@@ oth ra@@ mp of gradu@@ al ste@@ p-@@ by-@@ step incre@@ ment .
and the first paper is a standard scientific paper pres@@ enting evidence , &quot; i@@ ri@@ dium layer at the k-@@ t boundar@@ y , po@@ tas@@ si@@ um-@@ ar@@ gon d@@ ated cr@@ ater in yu@@ cat@@ an , indi@@ cate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
and that all ste@@ ms from the perception of athei@@ sts as some kind of weird , wa@@ y-@@ out min@@ ority .
similar figures ob@@ ta@@ ined for belief in personal im@@ mortality .
a@@ vel@@ ing was a milit@@ ant athei@@ st who failed to persu@@ ade darwin to accept the dedi@@ cation of his book on athei@@ sm -- inci@@ dent@@ ally , giving rise to a fascinating my@@ th that kar@@ l mar@@ x tried to dedi@@ cate &quot; das kapital &quot; to darwin , which he didn &apos;t . it was actually ed@@ ward a@@ vel@@ ing .
this has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-@@ organized associ@@ ations and journ@@ als and things already in place .
people are always going on about , &quot; how did september the 1@@ 1@@ th change you ? &quot;
and compu@@ tation , stor@@ age and communications capacity are in the hands of prac@@ tically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information , knowledge and culture , in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet .
so , all of that is in the creation of content , of relev@@ ance , basic human expression .
you have to hire people who know what they &apos;re doing .
it is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other , and the way information , knowledge and culture will be produced .
this is a story about the fact that people in africa are no longer willing to toler@@ ate corruption from their leaders .
we can invite partners who can support us , but we have to start .
so the market is there .
as tele@@ com@@ s sector grew , housing and construction , and i could go on and on . and this is to illu@@ strate to you that once you get the ma@@ cro@@ -@@ economy straig@@ h@@ ten@@ ed out , the opportunities in various other se@@ ctors are enormous .
this is better than the performance of many o@@ ec@@ d countries .
so that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing .
you know , the problem is if this virus occasi@@ onally mu@@ tat@@ es so dramatically , it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pande@@ mic .
they basically create a ca@@ che of weapons for your immune system which you can deplo@@ y when needed .
so that &apos;s why every year you can catch a slightly different stra@@ in of flu .
for the first time , we saw an aids vaccine work in humans -- al@@ b@@ eit , quite mo@@ dest@@ ly -- and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago .
let me give you another example .
chicken eggs , hundreds of millions of chicken eggs .
now think of where this leads us .
s@@ b : i think flu is different . i think what happened with flu is we &apos;ve got a bunch -- i just showed some of this -- a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now .
they &apos;re the dominant buil@@ ders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
the che@@ e@@ ta@@ h generation is a new bre@@ ed of africans who bro@@ ok no non@@ sense about corruption .
that &apos;s what the world bank says .
i asked them to name me just 20 .
take any african economy .
these societies are the i@@ bo , the som@@ ali , the ki@@ ku@@ y@@ us , for example . they have no chie@@ fs .
so , in a nu@@ t@@ shell , what we had in traditional africa was a fre@@ e-@@ market system .
it also means that he will be able to generate wealth .
and if we don &apos;t pay attention to it , it could be a real problem .
that &apos;s how different these results are becoming .
what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong .
thank you .
there &apos;s been kind of a series of epi@@ phan@@ ies .
now , i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- i &apos;m ki@@ dding -- but these are the rec@@ ap@@ it@@ u@@ lation slides , and then i &apos;m going to go into new material about what you can do .
there is a carbon calcul@@ ator . particip@@ ant produ@@ ctions conven@@ ed , with my active invol@@ vement , the leading software writers in the world on this ar@@ can@@ e science of carbon calcu@@ lation to construct a consu@@ mer@@ -@@ friendly carbon calcul@@ ator .
and in our modern country , the role of logic and reason no longer includes medi@@ ating between wealth and power the way it once did .
so the blo@@ w@@ out in the gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization .
if you go to the places where it &apos;s just arri@@ ving , like the eastern part of the gulf , in al@@ ab@@ ama , there &apos;s still people using the beach while there are people clean@@ ing up the beach .
and i learned -- in fact , i con@@ fir@@ med -- the hypo@@ thesis that oil and water don &apos;t mix until you add a dis@@ pers@@ ant , and then they start mix@@ ing .
so he moved away from it , turned around a few minutes later , it was right next to the side of the boat again .
and they popu@@ late much larger areas .
here they are working .
we could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need .
the first off@@ shore dri@@ ll@@ s were called har@@ po@@ ons .
i decided i wanted to make a star .
your genome is the entire sequence of your dna .
i could just go home now .
in order to find connectom@@ es , we have to see all the neurons at the same time .
and so i think we &apos;re ready to t@@ ack@@ le one of the most important questions in neuroscience : how are the brains of men and women different ?
it &apos;s absur@@ d .
and that &apos;s why every connectome is unique , even those of gene@@ tically identical tw@@ ins .
because , if the first neurons in the chain are activ@@ ated , through their synap@@ ses they send messages to the second neurons , which are activ@@ ated , and so on down the line , like a chain of falling domin@@ oes .
if you pay 100,000 dollars , you can ar@@ range to have your body frozen after death and stor@@ ed in liquid ni@@ tro@@ gen in one of these tan@@ ks in an ari@@ zon@@ a war@@ e@@ house , a@@ waiting a future civilization that is advanced to res@@ ur@@ rect you .
it comes from a company in japan called gel@@ tech . now go ahead and open it up .
do you have a need for speed ?
ks : some of them automatically un@@ roll like this one .
so here , come on up to the front . all right , so now if you &apos;ll see here -- no , no , it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s techni@@ cally called , &quot; sha@@ pe@@ -@@ re@@ taining property . &quot;
and these d@@ yes change color in response to od@@ ors .
the best cul@@ in@@ ary experience of my life .
not a lot of people are doing it .
they impli@@ cated actually , the span@@ ish government , ama@@ z@@ ingly .
and i thought , ok , excited je@@ w from new york , right ?
now , what happened ?
it &apos;s the indi@@ cation that it &apos;s the best foie gras .
and this squ@@ ad@@ ron of ge@@ ese come over .
it &apos;s brilliant , right ?
and i ended up like going down the sp@@ ices , and finally , it was like , ok , salt and pe@@ pper , thinking he &apos;s sal@@ ted and pe@@ p@@ per@@ ed his liver .
he said , &quot; i think it &apos;s an insu@@ lt to history . &quot;
and he dem@@ anded that the je@@ ws supply enough for everyone .
really new .
those fossil fuels have built our civilization .
and whether you care most about prof@@ its and jobs and competi@@ tive advantage or national security , or environmental ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship and climate protection and public health , rein@@ venting fire makes sense and makes money .
also last year , bm@@ w announced this carbon fiber electric car , they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by nee@@ ding fewer batter@@ ies .
together , those things can give us the same or better access with 4@@ 6 to 8@@ 4 percent less driving , saving another 0.@@ 4 trillion dollars , plus 0.@@ 3 trillion dollars from using trucks more produ@@ ctively .
and we can do this just by reas@@ on@@ ably acceler@@ ating existing trends .
our team has l@@ ately found such sno@@ w@@ ball@@ ing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial re@@ designs -- everything from data centers and chip fab@@ s to min@@ es and re@@ fin@@ er@@ ies .
h@@ our@@ ly simu@@ lations show that largely or wh@@ ol@@ ly renew@@ able gri@@ ds can deliver highly reli@@ able power when they &apos;re fore@@ ca@@ sted , integrated and diver@@ si@@ fied by both type and location .
it &apos;s fallen by half .
i grew up in bi@@ har , india &apos;s poorest state , and i remember when i was six years old , i remember coming home one day to find a c@@ art full of the most deli@@ cious s@@ wee@@ ts at our do@@ or@@ step .
the first key shift is open knowledge .
and the government is respon@@ sive . so for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school re@@ pa@@ irs had st@@ alled due to corruption , the department of education in the phili@@ pp@@ ines took swi@@ ft action .
how do we make sure that development and aid money actually goes to the people who most need it ? san@@ jay pra@@ d@@ han of the world bank institute la@@ ys out three gui@@ del@@ ines to help re@@ lief efforts make the most impact -- while cur@@ bing corruption . one key : connecting the players who are working to change broken systems with the data they need .
what is the life of the ow@@ ner of this mouth ? in what society &#91; does &#93; this guy live ?
yes , she said , something like that . ok , that means we are at half of the story .
i raise the angle of vision , but it &apos;s still very -- sel@@ fish , sel@@ fish , e@@ go@@ i@@ ste -- yes , sel@@ fish .
never forget -- like that , like that .
you must go back to politics , you must go back to radi@@ c@@ alization , i &apos;m sorry if that &apos;s not very english .
we give you white pages . invent .
no , we &apos;re having a little fun .
i &apos;m your worst night@@ m@@ are . i &apos;m your da@@ d@@ dy and your mom@@ my .
it &apos;s her language i will learn . &quot;
i was a public school kid in new york city , and i didn &apos;t do well at all .
and that &apos;s the key to success .
and it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people , and i &apos;m sure have wonderful families and children and grand@@ children , it &apos;s not enough . you &apos;ve got to reach out and back and find kids like mr. cru@@ z who can make it if you give them the structure , if you reach back and help , if you ment@@ or , if you invest in boys and girls clu@@ bs , if you work with your school system , make sure it &apos;s the best school system , and not just your kid &apos;s school , but the school up@@ town in har@@ lem , not just down@@ town mon@@ t@@ ess@@ or@@ i on the west side .
i did it just last week . it was on a tu@@ es@@ day evening down by colum@@ bus circle .
they can listen and join the conversation .
giving people less control might be a wonderful way to counter the abund@@ ance of choice and make them happier .
because everyone was a hero .
plat@@ forms like youtube , twitter , facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impres@@ sion that , &quot; wow , i &apos;m not alone .
and everyone started to think that &quot; this guy could be my brother . &quot;
this whole page was , again , managed by the people .
it &apos;s actually strength -- it &apos;s power .
thanks a lot .
a six-@@ mon@@ ther ad@@ ores the task .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about .
what you see here is the audio result -- no learning what@@ so@@ ever -- and the video result -- no learning what@@ so@@ ever .
patri@@ cia ku@@ hl shares astonishing fin@@ dings about how babies learn one language over another -- by listening to the humans around them and &quot; taking statistics &quot; on the sounds they need to know . clever lab experiments show how 6@@ -@@ mon@@ th-@@ old babies use sophisticated reas@@ oning to understand their world . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so we had this speaker set up , and we had the camera facing it , and lots of lights poin@@ ting at the speaker , and i would set up the speaker , put the tiny little cryst@@ als on top of that speaker , and we would do this over and over again , and it was until mid@@ day that i realized that i had a completely red face because of the lights poin@@ ting at the speaker .
and at the same time , it tries to maintain its position above the mag@@ net , and therefore , it creates those ama@@ z@@ ing-@@ looking structures of chan@@ nels and tiny little pon@@ ds of color@@ ful water paint .
so the images that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a fl@@ ame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle , and you have to imagine it was fli@@ pped around 1@@ 80 degrees .
i looked into the face of her son sitting next to her , and his face was just ri@@ ven with g@@ rief and con@@ fusion .
and it was really her strength , i believe , that became the kind of mu@@ dr@@ a and im@@ pri@@ ma@@ tur that has been a gui@@ ding light in my life .
the very feeling of terror is global .
she stands with 10,000 arms , and in every hand , there is an instrument of liber@@ ation , and in the palm of every hand , there are eyes , and these are the eyes of wisdom .
budd@@ h@@ ist ro@@ sh@@ i jo@@ an hal@@ i@@ fa@@ x works with people at the last stage of life . she shares what she &apos;s learned about compassion in the face of death and dying , and a deep insight into the nature of empathy .
one plus one gives us two , and one plus four gives us five .
it &apos;s one squ@@ ared plus one squ@@ ared plus two squ@@ ared plus three squ@@ ared plus five squ@@ ared plus eight squ@@ ared . right ?
these are dile@@ mm@@ as i have every day .
but as you can see , when i talk , i speak with an american ac@@ cent , which you would think as an irani@@ an-@@ american actor , i should be able to play any part , good , bad , what have you .
&quot; and fur@@ ther@@ more , it is the thought that coun@@ ts . &quot;
it &apos;s like a drug deal .
i go , &quot; i &apos;m sorry . then why were you star@@ ing at me ? &quot;
now i feel bad about that .
you dec@@ ei@@ ved yourself .
now , as many of you may remember , the red bri@@ ga@@ des was a terror@@ ist , mar@@ x@@ ist organization which was very active in it@@ aly from the 196@@ 0s until the mid-@@ 198@@ 0s .
i &apos;ll give you an idea .
so , in the end , i took a decision that , in retro@@ spe@@ ct , did change my life .
this is when we see the birth of the trans@@ national arms organization al q@@ ae@@ da .
these were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror , illegal and crimin@@ al economy .
people simply moved their mon@@ e@@ y-@@ la@@ under@@ ing activities away from the united states into europe .
now , some of you might be thinking , &quot; hold on a minute . she doesn &apos;t look very much like an ocean ro@@ wer .
the atlantic ro@@ wing race runs from the can@@ aries to anti@@ gu@@ a , it &apos;s about 3,000 miles , and it turned out to be the har@@ dest thing i had ever done .
it was absolutely wonderful .
well , naturally , you decide to row across the pacific .
fall down nine times , get up 10 .
i eventually made it to hawaii still alive .
we do have alterna@@ tives , and we have the power of free will to choose those alterna@@ tives , those sustainable ones , to create a green@@ er future .
it &apos;s meant to be a bit of a game .
but any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is , in fact , what you were just talking about , what was going on here , setting up ted , small@@ -@@ scale architecture -- at the present time can &apos;t really happen without a conversation about this , the world trade center , and what &apos;s been going on there , what it means to us .
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
this is the work of a firm called shop , and what you &apos;re seeing here , is their is@@ om@@ et@@ ric dra@@ wings of what will be a lar@@ ge-@@ scale camera ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ a in a public park .
l@@ est you think this is all fiction , l@@ est you think this is all fan@@ t@@ asy , or roman@@ ce , these same architects were asked to produce something for the central cour@@ ty@@ ard of p@@ s@@ 1 , which is a museum in brooklyn , new york , as part of their young architects summer series .
they &apos;re now building a 16@@ -@@ story building on the side of new york , using the same technology .
it &apos;s about bringing nature to the inside .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i wondered , what made my dreams so easy to dis@@ miss ?
turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , i said , &quot; yeah , you can copy my home@@ work , &quot; and i gave him all the wrong answers that i &apos;d written down the night before .
we both got moved to the back of class so we would stop getting bom@@ bar@@ ded by spit@@ balls .
you signed it , &quot; they were wrong . &quot;
the background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spec@@ tral analysis .
so please , without further a@@ do .
in the north , the bor@@ e@@ al is bor@@ dered by the tun@@ dr@@ a , and just below that , in yu@@ k@@ on , we have this incredible valley , the tom@@ b@@ stone valley .
that would be a huge , vast me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan area , probably much larger than the city of vic@@ tor@@ ia .
and you can see in the context , it &apos;s just a relatively small section of one of 10 mining complex@@ es and another 40 to 50 on stream to be appro@@ ved soon .
this is a globally significant we@@ t@@ land , perhaps the greatest on the planet .
and we need to all gather together and say no to the t@@ ar sands .
since bal@@ a himself will be speaking at ted i won &apos;t spend too much time on him here today , except to say that he really succe@@ eds at making the invisible visible .
they frequ@@ ently explore the@@ mes of globalization and ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation , and their home of delhi is a frequ@@ ent element in their work .
all the gra@@ ye@@ d-@@ out species disappear .
when you see a diagram like this , i don &apos;t want you to be afraid .
i don &apos;t want gam@@ ers to regre@@ t the time they spent playing , time that i encoura@@ ged them to spend .
i wish i &apos;d had the courage to express my true self .
now , why a game ?
and they even talked about feeling happier , even though they were in pain , even though they were tac@@ kl@@ ing the tou@@ gh@@ est challenge of their lives .
that would be good , right ?
now that &apos;s worth pl@@ us-@@ one mental resilience , which means you have more mental focus , more discipl@@ ine , determin@@ ation and will@@ power .
all right , everybody , that is pl@@ us-@@ one social resilience , which means you actually get more strength from your friends , your neighbors , your family , your community .
and when you get there , more than likely , you will not have any of those top five regre@@ ts , because you will have built up the strength and resilience to lead a life tru@@ er to your dreams .
and if the ble@@ ach@@ ing doesn &apos;t go away -- if the temper@@ atures don &apos;t go down -- re@@ ef@@ s start to die .
and it was exhi@@ b@@ ited al@@ ong@@ side ours .
some of the best mathemati@@ cians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible .
so we ask the question again , &quot; how many straight lines can i draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? &quot;
and you go , &quot; ah ! i can see it . i can feel it .
it turns out that the natural world is full of hyper@@ bo@@ lic wonder@@ s .
we live in a society now where we have lots of think tan@@ ks , where great minds go to think about the world .
the first example is an extraordinary syndro@@ me called cap@@ gras syndro@@ me .
this has never made much sense to me , this argument .
and then the message cas@@ ca@@ des into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , and then goes down the autonom@@ ic nervous system .
so this explains why through the phone he recogni@@ zes his mother , no problem .
it sounds like an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
you have a car@@ d@@ board box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom -- so my first patient , derek , came in .
&quot; and move your normal hand . &quot;
&quot; so , can you change the design and put it on my fore@@ head , so i can , you know , do this and elimin@@ ate my phantom fingers ? &quot;
this is called syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia . gal@@ ton called it syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia , a m@@ ing@@ ling of the senses .
in all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
well , it &apos;s one or two mu@@ tan@@ ts .
but -- actually , we have a lot to learn from them , because they &apos;re a very eg@@ al@@ itarian society and they &apos;re a very em@@ pa@@ thetic society .
he &apos;s a bon@@ ob@@ o .
none of them are tricks .

compare the ch@@ al@@ k writing with the le@@ x@@ ig@@ ra@@ m on the keyboard .
dr. sue thinks it &apos;s important to allow such curiosity to fl@@ our@@ ish .
so we &apos;re sharing tools and technology and language with another species .
on a still bigger scale , we see entire galaxies of stars .
but the un@@ finished business for 21@@ st-@@ century science is to link together co@@ smo@@ s and micro-@@ world with a uni@@ fied theory -- symboli@@ zed , as it were , ga@@ stron@@ om@@ ically at the top of that picture .
and more than that , it &apos;s en@@ gen@@ der@@ ing new kinds of change .
and they were inspired not by the young einstein , who did the great work in rela@@ tivity , but by the old einstein , the ic@@ on of poster and t-@@ shirt , who failed in his scientific efforts to uni@@ fy the physical laws .
and i &apos;d like to end with a vi@@ g@@ ne@@ tte , as it were , inspired by this image .
the science done by the young einstein will continue as long as our civilization , but for civilization to survive , we &apos;ll need the wisdom of the old einstein -- human@@ e , global and far@@ seeing .
one person wrote in , &quot; when i win , i &apos;m going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top . &quot;
we called them up at night and asked them , &quot; what &apos;d you spend it on , and how happy do you feel now ? &quot;
describe it . how happy did it make you ? &quot;
they had no money , they went to a clinic and i gave her this money . &quot;
what about your work life , which is where we spend all the rest of our time when we &apos;re not with the people we know .
so some teams , we give people on the team money , they spend it on themselves .
it &apos;s actually from y@@ it@@ z@@ ha@@ k rab@@ in .
but with the end of the cold war came also the end of the israeli@@ -@@ irani@@ an cold peace .
the e@@ b@@ bs and flows of ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty have not shif@@ ted with ide@@ ological ze@@ al , but rather with changes in the geo@@ political landscape .
two days it took the times online to make a map , a mas@@ hab@@ le map -- we call these things ma@@ sh@@ -@@ ups -- a mas@@ he@@ d-@@ up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected .
the red circles are poll@@ ing stations , selec@@ ted by your cri@@ teri@@ a .
so , if you &apos;ve been involved in that at all , i just wanted to say : whatever you &apos;ve been doing , whether you &apos;ve just been chan@@ ting , &quot; raw data now ! &quot;
the united states is le@@ ster@@ land .
it &apos;s for their private interest . in this sense , the usa is worse than le@@ ster@@ land .
block reform .
if the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fund@@ raising from the tin@@ i@@ est sli@@ ce of america , the solution is to have them spend less time fund@@ raising but fund@@ raise from a wider sli@@ ce of americans , to spread it out , to spread the fun@@ der influence so that we re@@ store the idea of depen@@ dence upon the people alone .
there &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;

or the gall@@ up po@@ ll that showed that seven in 10 americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
now when i got out , i was diagnosed and i was given medi@@ cations by a psychi@@ atr@@ ist .
and everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
do you need , for instance , to be as smart as you are ?
and third , they &apos;re all attra@@ cted to each other , but they try to keep a small distance apart .
we don &apos;t , however , really understand at a mathematical level .
scientific papers were published saying it was twi@@ t@@ ching eye@@ li@@ ds that explained it , or , you know , a human being &apos;s tenden@@ cy to see patterns where there are none .
can you hear that ?
and together they sub@@ mit@@ ted a design based on lord fo@@ ster &apos;s vision , which was -- he remember@@ ed as a kid reading fl@@ ash gor@@ don com@@ ic books , and he said that when fl@@ ash gor@@ don would come to an ab@@ y@@ ss , he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light s@@ aber .
intervie@@ wer : ah ! now , tell me why you had to do this ?
the most dramatic and sho@@ cking footage shows whole se@@ ctions of the crowd -- hundreds of people -- apparently ro@@ cking from side to side in un@@ ison , not only with each other , but with the bridge .
and the only way you can walk comfort@@ ably is by getting in step .
now , imagine each one of these var@@ ie@@ ties as being distin@@ ct from another about the same way as a po@@ od@@ le from a great dan@@ e .
see , we used to have a lot of ap@@ ples .
if agriculture hasn &apos;t experienced that , how could it be adap@@ ted ?
in rwanda , in the sol@@ om@@ on islands .
i think of it as sort of a ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral .
because , quite literally , if agriculture doesn &apos;t adapt to climate change , neither will we .
this message is given as a public service .
by the way , i must admit , my english is not so good , i didn &apos;t know what is sc@@ ro@@ tal ; i understand it &apos;s a sc@@ ro@@ tum .
and i feel very stron@@ g@@ ly that it &apos;s not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it &apos;s ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it .
and i wrote them down and i found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful ren@@ ais@@ s@@ ance of avi@@ ation .
these two new air@@ planes are the same speed as the d@@ c@@ 8 that was done in 195@@ 8 .
but i think once it does , we will find solutions , and very quickly , you &apos;ll see those res@@ ort hot@@ els in orbit .
it went a whole life cycle without competition , took out of service . and we &apos;re stuck back here with the same kind of cap@@ ability for military figh@@ ters and commercial air@@ line travel that we had back in the late &apos; 5@@ 0s .
i think what we &apos;ll do is we &apos;ll see a successful , very successful , private space flight industry . whether we &apos;re first or not really doesn &apos;t matter .
humanity is building a machine , and this en@@ ables us to collabor@@ ate in new ways .
the guy in the picture here , i &apos;ll tell you his story .
they came from computer scientists , engineers .
ibm gave away 400 million dollars of software to the lin@@ u@@ x movement , and that gave them a multi-@@ billion dollar pa@@ yo@@ ff .
you think that social media is about hoo@@ king up online ?
people started to learn about things , and when they did , the institutions of feu@@ dal society appeared to be st@@ alled , or frozen , or fail@@ ing .
well , the mur@@ mu@@ ration functions to record a number of principles , and they &apos;re basically the principles that i have described to you today .
and these are the vessels of life , and , as i &apos;ll show you , they can also be the vessels of death .
and , in fact , can@@ cers don &apos;t start out with a blood supply .
so , a few years ago , i asked myself , &quot; can we take this one step further and treat other can@@ cers , even in other species ? &quot;
the bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemo@@ therapy , or surgery , or radiation available .
and here is a growing list of our anti@@ angiogen@@ ic foods and be@@ ver@@ ages that we &apos;re interested in studying .
so this human study is a prime example of how anti@@ angiogen@@ ic sub@@ stances present in food and consum@@ ed at practical levels can impact on cancer .
i hope i &apos;ve convinced you that , for diseases like cancer , obesity and other conditions , that there may be a great power in attac@@ king their common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator : angiogen@@ esis .
i &apos;ve been doing that for about 10 years .
you know , they might have a solution .
origin@@ ally i tried to do the words &quot; figure &quot; and &quot; ground . &quot;
and here it is , figu@@ re-@@ ground .
i didn &apos;t come up with the original idea . but this is another way i work as an invent@@ or is to create a sequ@@ el .
one of these weigh@@ s 50 pounds , 30 pounds and 10 pounds .
a lot of people do su@@ dok@@ u . in fact some doctors prescri@@ be it .
that &apos;s the corner of the whole thing .
to be a woman means not to be a girl .
but what happened for me is that that sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing actually em@@ bol@@ den@@ ed me in a way i have never been em@@ bol@@ den@@ ed .
i &apos;ve seen girls who were be@@ aten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and un@@ cles .
and this girl , when she was 17 years old , wor@@ e a bur@@ q@@ a in afghanistan , and went into the sta@@ di@@ ums and docum@@ ented the at@@ ro@@ cities that were going on towards women , underneath her bur@@ q@@ a , with a video .
and she said , &quot; well , now , i need a house . &quot;
i had the privilege of being in the hut when she was re@@ united with her father and re@@ conc@@ iled .
i can feel what you &apos;re feeling as you &apos;re feeling inside the feeling before .
i know that li@@ p@@ stick means more than show , and boys are super inse@@ cure , and so-called terrori@@ sts are made , not born .
a father came out of his house to tell his teen@@ age son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop hor@@ sing around on the front la@@ wn and on the side@@ walk , to get home , finish their school@@ work , and prepare themselves for bed .
we know that eye@@ witness identifi@@ cations are fal@@ li@@ ble .
as you can see , it is at best poor .
he was totally sto@@ ic . i couldn &apos;t see a twi@@ tch of his eye@@ bro@@ w .
one sugge@@ stion is that all of us become much more att@@ un@@ ed to the ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty , through policy , through proce@@ dur@@ es , to get more science in the cour@@ tro@@ om , and i think one large step toward that is more requi@@ rements , with all due respect to the law schools , of science , technology , engineering , mathematics for anyone going into the law , because they become the jud@@ ges .
and other mathemati@@ cians did the same sort of thing .
and so i finally got to this city , and i &apos;d done a little fra@@ c@@ tal model for the city just to see how it would sort of un@@ fold -- but when i got there , i got to the pal@@ ace of the chief , and my french is not very good ; i said something like , &quot; i am a mathemati@@ cian and i would like to stand on your roof . &quot;
and i started to realize that the cycles of fertili@@ ty were just like the rec@@ ur@@ sive cycles in the ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric algorith@@ m that buil@@ ds this .
and finally , well , isn &apos;t this just intuition ?
so i tra@@ cked down one of the folks who makes these things , this guy in mal@@ i just outside of ba@@ ma@@ ko , and i asked him , &quot; how come you &apos;re making fra@@ c@@ tal f@@ ences ? because nobody else is . &quot;
and finally , he reve@@ aled the truth of the matter .
we &apos;ve focused in the u.s. on afri@@ can@@ -@@ american students as well as native american and lat@@ in@@ o .
the last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family .
one has lac@@ ro@@ sse on the near side of town .
in su@@ ther@@ land &apos;s system , companies don &apos;t use large , massive projects that take two years .
the week we introduced a morning check@@ list into our house , it cut par@@ ent@@ al scre@@ aming in half .
the word &quot; agi@@ le &quot; entered the le@@ xic@@ on in 2001 when jeff su@@ ther@@ land and a group of designers met in u@@ ta@@ h and wrote a 12@@ -@@ point agi@@ le mani@@ fest@@ o .
the rest of it &apos;s taken up with &quot; take your el@@ bo@@ ws off the table &quot; and &quot; pass the ket@@ ch@@ up . &quot;
i loved that . spend the time however you want .
so he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement .
the children who sc@@ ored highest on this &quot; do you know &quot; scale had the highest self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em and a greater sense they could control their lives .
you don &apos;t need some grand plan . you don &apos;t need a water@@ fall .
and we &apos;re talking really small here .
mark sha@@ w : one very dry dem@@ o
that movie is so horrible . it pro@@ mot@@ es such awful p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ science .
but it was something he later turned to his advantage .
nt : yes , that was a big mistake .
but they thought that , if you had a neuro@@ logic or psychi@@ atri@@ c disease , it must be because you are pos@@ s@@ essed by an evil spirit .
with parkin@@ son &apos;s disease , and this lady has parkin@@ son &apos;s disease , and she has these electro@@ des in her brain , and i &apos;m going to show you what she &apos;s like when the electro@@ des are turned off and she has her parkin@@ son &apos;s symptoms , and then we &apos;re going to turn it on .
the only way he could get around was cra@@ w@@ ling on his bel@@ ly like this .
so now we are in clinical trials , and are in phase i@@ ii clinical trials , and this may become a new proce@@ d@@ ure , if it &apos;s safe and we find that it &apos;s effective , to treat patients with severe depression .
and indeed , we are able to get these areas of the brain that were not using glu@@ co@@ se to use glu@@ co@@ se once again .
and if we could figure that out , how can we imple@@ ment those designs ?
and we told them , of course , they move in another plane as well .
for example , here &apos;s a leg : the clear part is sti@@ ff , the white part is compli@@ ant , and you don &apos;t need any ax@@ les there or anything .
it &apos;s this technique of building the properties into the form .
here &apos;s the geck@@ o running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit .
and if you blow that up , and zoom in 9@@ 00 times , you see there are ha@@ irs there , tiny ha@@ irs . and if you look carefully , those tiny ha@@ irs have stri@@ ations . and if you zoom in on those 3@@ 0,000 times , you &apos;ll see each hair has split ends .
where &apos;s this going ? i think you can see it already .
and i &apos;m in the meeting -- it &apos;s about a three-@@ hour meeting -- and two hours in , there kind of needs to be that bi@@ o break , and everyone stands up , and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarras@@ sed .
this is hard . i feel guil@@ ty sometimes .
and car@@ r@@ ie says , &quot; boy , i feel like i didn &apos;t really draw out the main point on the he@@ ge@@ li@@ an di@@ al@@ ec@@ tic . &quot;
there &apos;s a famous harvard business school study on a woman named hei@@ di ro@@ i@@ zen .
and i had my hand up with lots of other people , and you took two more questions .
&quot; how am i going to fit this into everything else i &apos;m doing ? &quot;
and it &apos;s not just because people would know where the women &apos;s ba@@ thro@@ oms are , even though that would be very hel@@ p@@ ful .
den@@ ti@@ stry might seem -- and i think it is -- many den@@ ti@@ sts would have to ac@@ knowledge it &apos;s somewhat of a m@@ und@@ ane back@@ water of medicine .
they wanted to capture one other vari@@ able , which was the patients &apos; sense of eff@@ ic@@ acy .
now here &apos;s what does work : person@@ alized information works .
but it works , and it even has some health re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ sions .
god for@@ bi@@ d we should use that same standard that we make cap &apos;@@ n cr@@ un@@ ch live by and bring it to drug companies .
this is our one-@@ page sum@@ mary .
we use the person &apos;s age and their gender to start to fill in the person@@ alized risks .
anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions : can i have my results ?
it &apos;s not my idea , other people have hit on it , but i &apos;ve tried to take it to some new places .
and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention , not as a human technology , but as a co-@@ evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species , mostly edi@@ ble gras@@ ses , had explo@@ ited us , figured out how to get us to basically de@@ forest the world .
as soon as you start seeing things from the plant &apos;s point of view or the animal &apos;s point of view , you realize that the real liter@@ ary conc@@ eit is that -- is the idea that nature is opposed to culture , the idea that consciousness is everything -- and that &apos;s another very important thing it does .
and you will see , the amount of corn plan@@ ted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we &apos;ve decided ethan@@ ol is going to help us .
and the reason he &apos;s wa@@ ited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day , those lar@@ va@@ e will hat@@ ch and he &apos;ll have a huge fly problem .
and what i realized when i understood this -- and if you ask jo@@ el sal@@ a@@ tin what he is , he &apos;ll tell you he &apos;s not a chicken farmer , he &apos;s not a sheep farmer , he &apos;s not a c@@ attle ran@@ cher ; he &apos;s a grass farmer , because grass is really the key@@ stone species of such a system -- is that , if you think about it , this completely con@@ tradi@@ cts the tra@@ gic idea of nature we hold in our heads , which is that for us to get what we want , nature is di@@ min@@ ished .
it &apos;s filled with lots of different things that , in short , aren &apos;t that fun .
so , the social layer is all about these connections .
to win , all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time .
influence and status .
it can be used in interesting ways .
and commun@@ al discovery is powerful because it le@@ ver@@ ages the network that is society to solve problems .
let &apos;s all build it together , let &apos;s do it well and have fun playing .
there &apos;s a lot of activity in china .
now , each one of those quer@@ ies has an interesting life and tale of its own .
audience : or@@ ku@@ t .
and -- well , i &apos;ll leave you in sus@@ pen@@ se .
and i don &apos;t know about all of you , but i have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once .
and as a result , we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting , so when you walk into a meeting room now , it li@@ sts all the meetings that are happening , you can very easily take notes , and they just get e@@ ma@@ iled automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting .
so the idea is we can make advertising useful , not just anno@@ ying , right ?
and our algorithms -- not a person , of course , but our algorithms , our computers -- the related search was , &quot; i am bor@@ ed . &quot;
this is the second project that i did . it &apos;s a fa@@ x machine .
this is the s@@ .@@ s. great western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey .
con@@ version sound has developed a high quality , ultra@@ -@@ low-@@ cost digital hearing aid for the developing world .
so i &apos;d like to take the idea that r@@ ory su@@ ther@@ land talked about , this notion that in@@ tan@@ gible things are worth perhaps more than physical things , and take that a little bit further and say that i think the design of partici@@ pat@@ ory systems , in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured , is going to be the major theme , not only for design , but also for our economy as we go forward .
so why design thinking ?
i &apos;m actually really quite interested , and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on .
pretty soon , a l@@ eng@@ thy discussion en@@ su@@ ed , and finally the manager came over to me and said , &quot; i am very sorry . we do not have sugar . &quot;
in one study , which we ran in japan@@ town , san francisco , we brought se@@ ven@@ - to nin@@ e-@@ year-old an@@ glo@@ - and asi@@ an-@@ american children into the laboratory , and we divided them up into three groups .
it leaves little room for inter@@ depen@@ dence or an ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ gment of individual fal@@ li@@ bility .
they were f@@ loo@@ ded with choice before they could pro@@ test that they didn &apos;t know how to swim .
we all have physical , mental and emotional limit@@ ations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter , even in the gro@@ cer@@ y store , let alone over the course of our entire lives .
french parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; no@@ ah was here for so little time , but he taught us so much .
robert fro@@ st once said that , &quot; it is poetry that is lost in trans@@ lation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant sha@@ de of pink . &quot;
well , the three big problems have in common that they are man@@ -@@ made problems but they are controlled by natural forces .
what if the entire boat becomes a point of control ?
an airplane , when you &apos;re moving in this direction , starts to lift , and that &apos;s how it takes off .
they also made it into an instruc@@ table , and in less than one week , they had almost 10,000 views , and they got many new friends .
so it &apos;s about time that we talked about how the computer am@@ bus@@ hed television , or why the invention of the atom@@ ic bomb un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed forces that lead to the writers &apos; stri@@ ke .
everybody in the east coast gets in the pictures -- ci@@ tic@@ or@@ p , pen@@ ney , r@@ ca -- all getting into this big vision .
with consider@@ able tre@@ pi@@ dation , we under@@ take to interview this new machine .
and you can imagine that the air force became a pretty good sal@@ es@@ man .
but it gives you the kind of power that people have , that the audience has , and the reasons these transforma@@ tions are happening .
ph : it was the da@@ wn of interactive tv , and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the win@@ ky din@@ k k@@ its .
and it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean harmon@@ y and peace and quiet , but it does mean huge invol@@ vement in everybody else &apos;s aff@@ air@@ s .
i think these ideas are difficult to understand , because when you &apos;re tra@@ pped in one paradigm , the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense .
now , as long as we con@@ fine this to the education market , and a personal matter between the computer and the fi@@ le system , that &apos;s fine , but as you can see , it was about to lea@@ p out and up@@ set jack val@@ ent@@ i and a lot of other people .
ted tur@@ ner : we did the work to build this , this cable industry , now the broad@@ ca@@ sters want some of our money . i mean , it &apos;s ridiculous .
that &apos;s about 2,@@ 700 fresh , conne@@ ctive links across about 1@@ 12 million blogs that are out there .
what the entertainment business is strug@@ gling with , the world of br@@ ands is figuring out .
thanks very much .
but i began looking at design in a place like am@@ ster@@ dam and recognized , you know , the first job of design is to serve a social purpose .
red drew me into this little com@@ position , optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service &apos;s ma@@ il@@ box , door service , plum@@ bing .
a change might be a typical street corner in san francisco .
but they &apos;re real examples in ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation and the change that &apos;s occurred in the last number of years , and the hei@@ ghten@@ ed sensi@@ tivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers .
he had high lea@@ ther bo@@ ots , jo@@ d@@ h@@ pur@@ s , an old lea@@ ther jac@@ ket , a wonderful hel@@ met and those mar@@ vel@@ ous go@@ g@@ gles -- and , inevi@@ t@@ ably , a white scar@@ f , to flow in the wind .
you had to learn about a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics .
so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry .
and the loo@@ se ideas had something to do with what i knew happened with people in the office , at the work place -- people who worked , and used task se@@ ating , a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long .
and why should you get a 20-@@ page man@@ ual about how to run a chair ?
all the weight of your upper tor@@ so -- your arms , your head -- goes right down through your back , your sp@@ ine , into those bones when you sit .
you c@@ ant hit your el@@ bow on bottom .
well , you could develop flu@@ -like symptoms .
so we must be good at killing mosqu@@ itos .
maybe a better product comes along in 20 , 30 years .
so the males will go out , they &apos;ll look for fe@@ males , they &apos;ll mate . if they mate success@@ fully , then no off@@ spring .
we &apos;ve separated the males from the fe@@ males .
&quot; could my doctor have war@@ ned me ? &quot;
now , i &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
this data &apos;s from all over the world -- countries spend billions of dollars invest@@ ing in this kind of research .
this is how paul did it . he did it with his iphone .
bill da@@ ven@@ hall : your health depends on where you live
that links with hot@@ dig@@ git@@ y@@ do@@ g@@ .@@ com@@ .
instead , i &apos;ll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue , which i will be refer@@ ring to as the phosphor@@ us crisis .
now , where do we find this phosphor@@ us ?
and because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant , all the rest is lost , we have to add more and more .
it truly is a parado@@ x@@ ical situation .
true sym@@ bio@@ sis .
my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za exists , it works , it &apos;s produced at an industrial scale and commer@@ ci@@ alized worldwide .
frei ot@@ to was starting to use fo@@ am bubble diagra@@ ms and fo@@ am bubble models to generate his man@@ n@@ heim conc@@ ert hall .
so , even a straight line , defined with calcul@@ us , is a curve .
so it &apos;s a single calcu@@ lation for every single component of the building that we &apos;re adding onto .
so , my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tro@@ pic@@ al fro@@ gs .
so , in vac@@ u@@ um-@@ formed plastic , in fi@@ ber@@ glass , and then even at the level of struc@@ tural steel , which you think of as being linear and mod@@ ular .
so so@@ y@@ be@@ ans have really explo@@ ded , showing how trade and globalization are really responsible for the connections to rain@@ forests and the amazon -- an incredibly strange and inter@@ connected world that we have today .
well , that &apos;s not even the worst example in the world .
weather patterns have changed .
and they &apos;re both happening at the same time .
but we can do this , and there are opportunities to make this work .
global pa@@ st@@ ures cover 30 million km ² .
we need to invest in real solutions : incentives for farmers , pre@@ c@@ ision agriculture , new cro@@ p var@@ ie@@ ties , dri@@ p irri@@ gation , gray water recycling , better til@@ lage practices , smar@@ ter di@@ ets .
that &apos;s his little de@@ pot behind him , and he ear@@ ns twice the nigeri@@ an minim@@ um wa@@ ge .
so the implications of that are vast , because it means that this is where emplo@@ yment is — 1.@@ 8 billion people — and this is where we can create a more eg@@ al@@ itarian world , because people are actually able to ear@@ n money and live and thri@@ ve , as andrew s@@ abor@@ u did .
well , i guess . you know , china has no — — no intellectual property , right ?
robert neu@@ wir@@ th : the power of the infor@@ mal economy
it &apos;s not a lot different than the one you see on my patient .
and we &apos;ve had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were funded by the u.s. military , using these prototyp@@ es , that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom including mov@@ able hands .
that &apos;s the idea .
so here &apos;s j@@ esse in our first little test with him .
please welcome am@@ anda kit@@ ts .
and we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery , including over a dozen of our wo@@ unded war@@ ri@@ ors in the u.s. ar@@ med services .
now this is a research arm , but it &apos;s made out of commercial components from here down and a few that i &apos;ve bor@@ ro@@ wed from around the world .
what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think , &quot; what hand gras@@ p pattern do i want ? &quot;
we want to develop these little tiny cap@@ su@@ les about the size of a piece of ris@@ ot@@ to that we can put into the muscles and tele@@ meter out the em@@ g signals , so that it &apos;s not wor@@ rying about electro@@ de contact .
when i first met cel@@ ine , a little over a year ago , she had gone for 18 months without any anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , and she was very ill .
how then can we en@@ sure that , in our search for the cure , we do not take an un@@ fair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pande@@ mic ?
if , for any reason , they feel that this might not be possible , then i think they should have to eth@@ ically justi@@ fy why the clinical trial should be condu@@ cted in the first place .
we &apos;re not paying the true environmental costs of our actions .
i thought i was going to study the social behavior of gala@@ pa@@ gos penguins , but you already know penguins are rare .
so it &apos;s a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea li@@ ons and the marine i@@ gu@@ anas ...
the nice thing is , if you look down here in ar@@ gent@@ ina , there &apos;s no surface oil pollution from this com@@ posite map .
but we &apos;ve been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go .
he &apos;s coming up to one of my graduate students and fli@@ pper pat@@ ting , which he would do to a female pengu@@ in .
this is my box up here , and this is the system that works .
border conflicts can der@@ a@@ il so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here .
in fact , the world bank predi@@ cts that russia &apos;s population is dec@@ lin@@ ing towards about 120 million people and there is another thing that you don &apos;t see on this map .
but hold on . this map is 700 years old .
so china is becoming the an@@ ch@@ or of the economy in the region .
oil used to be one of the forces holding iraq together ; now it is the most significant cause of the country &apos;s dis@@ integration .
the lesson from kur@@ di@@ stan and from palest@@ ine is that indepen@@ dence alone , without infrastructure , is fu@@ tile .
a@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an was a for@@ gotten corner of the cau@@ c@@ uses , but now with the bak@@ u-@@ t@@ bili@@ si@@ -@@ ce@@ y@@ han pipel@@ ine into tur@@ key , it has re@@ brand@@ ed itself as the fron@@ tier of the west .
even if these regions aren &apos;t part of the e.@@ u@@ . , they are becoming part of its sphere of influence .
south sud@@ an is going to be having a refer@@ end@@ um in 2011 in which it is very likely to vote itself indepen@@ dence .
but if you look in nature , you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifes@@ p@@ ans .
now get out your hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs here .
and the da@@ f-@@ 2 gene en@@ codes a hormone re@@ cep@@ tor .
so after we made our discoveries with little c. elegan@@ s , people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking , if we made the same da@@ f-@@ 2 mutation , the hormone re@@ cep@@ tor mutation , in other animals , will they live longer ?
and the way that they &apos;re swit@@ ched on is by a gene regul@@ ator protein called fo@@ x@@ o .
but what we think is that , under conditions of stress , the levels of these hor@@ mon@@ es drop -- for example , having limited food supply .
a fo@@ x@@ o is a protein that we found in these little , round wor@@ ms to affect lifes@@ pan , and here it affec@@ ts lifes@@ pan in people .
but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
m@@ r : but what you &apos;re talking about here is not exten@@ ding human lifes@@ pan by pre@@ venting death , so much as exten@@ ding human you@@ th@@ sp@@ an .
whereas the city of tor@@ onto clearly doesn &apos;t want you involved with the planning process , otherwise their ads would look something like this -- with all the information basically laid out clearly .
they all have heroes who were chosen .
you add all this up together and of course people are a@@ pa@@ thetic .
a questi@@ on@@ na@@ ire .
but can an organism like a fruit fly , which is -- it &apos;s a great model organism because it &apos;s got a small brain , it &apos;s capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors , it bre@@ eds quickly , and it &apos;s cheap .
and what this quanti@@ fication showed us is that , upon experi@@ encing a train of these air pu@@ ffs , the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyper@@ activity which is persi@@ stent , long-@@ la@@ sting , and also appears to be gra@@ ded .
now what &apos;s the cau@@ sal relationship , if anything , between these phen@@ ot@@ yp@@ es ?
in fact , there &apos;s only one good thing i can think of when it gets to mosqu@@ itos .
that &apos;s right .
and then you see the dog . it &apos;s called t@@ we@@ ed . it &apos;s a border coll@@ ie .
i &apos;m sti@@ cking in my arm , i &apos;m giving them a big ju@@ ic@@ y blood meal , i &apos;m sha@@ king them off , and we follow them through time to see these mosqu@@ itos get very , very sick indeed , here shown in fast motion , and three hours later what we see at the bottom of the c@@ age is dead mosqu@@ itos , very dead mosqu@@ itos , and i &apos;m going to say , ladies and gentlemen , we have swa@@ pped the cards with mosqu@@ itos .
and the gift of life has been extended from bra@@ in-@@ dead don@@ ors to living , related don@@ ors -- rela@@ tives who might don@@ ate an organ or a part of an organ , like a split liver gra@@ ft , to a relative or loved one .
i wit@@ n@@ essed the technical difficul@@ ty .
in may 2006 , something horrible happened to me .
as we speak , the world &apos;s first human embr@@ y@@ onic stem cell trial for spinal cor@@ d in@@ jury is currently under@@ way following the us@@ f@@ da appro@@ val .
every year in the united states alone , 2,@@ 0@@ 7@@ 7@@ ,000 cou@@ ples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ...
they stal@@ k bli@@ ss@@ ful cou@@ ples and they study their every move and man@@ ner@@ ism .
the researchers were not looking at docum@@ ented self-@@ reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journ@@ als .
so now you may be wondering , why does anyone get married ever ?
if you look very carefully , you see that his skull has been re@@ placed with a transparent ple@@ xi@@ glas dome so that the work@@ ings of his brain can be obser@@ ved and also controlled with light .
we need to re@@ ar@@ range the pattern .
there &apos;s no high-@@ tech gi@@ z@@ mo@@ s here , just biology reve@@ aled through biology .
these head@@ less bodies can live for about a day , but they don &apos;t do much .
now obviously , the cri@@ tic is a key ingre@@ dient in what makes us intelligent .
so this anatom@@ y suggests that the mush@@ room bodies have something to do with action choice .
ger@@ o mi@@ es@@ en@@ bo@@ e@@ ck : re-@@ engineering the brain
this is li@@ bby , or actually , this is an ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und image of li@@ bby .
ed : all ri@@ ght@@ .@@ t@@ b : okay . turn it a little bit inside , a little bit toward the middle for me .
now i personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age .
i want to use technology that we &apos;re all working on and making happen to make health care a coordin@@ ated team sport .
so on my chart , i forced them to put , &quot; patient goal : low do@@ ses of drugs over longer peri@@ ods of time , side effects friendly to ski@@ ing . &quot;
let me share with you today an original discovery .
ly@@ nn ver@@ in@@ sky : because of li@@ ability insurance .
even though we put a passi@@ ve bar there .
but this time what we did is we put a sli@@ p@@ per@@ y pat@@ ch that you see in yellow there .
okay , now we wondered , if we were right , we should be able to test this in a physical model , in a robot .
maybe it &apos;s evolved from coming down from trees , and trying to control a gli@@ de .
and here is the first active tail , in the robot , made by boston dynamics .
and by this weird qu@@ ir@@ k of alphab@@ e@@ tical order of the nations , a lot of the low-@@ lying states , like ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i and n@@ au@@ r@@ u , they were se@@ ated at the very end of these immen@@ sely long ro@@ ws .
so anything that influ@@ ences how ocean surface wat@@ ers mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet .
so that trip just ended , and i can &apos;t show you too many results from that right now , but we &apos;ll go back one more year , to another dri@@ ll@@ ing expedition i &apos;ve been involved in .
it can only get there if it &apos;s carried out by ice .
this is a ble@@ ach@@ ed coral , coral that died during the 198@@ 2@@ - &apos; 8@@ 3 el nin@@ o .
i &apos;ll take you back here to the gala@@ pa@@ gos islands .
we work with tree r@@ ings .
it has many consequences .
he pro@@ posed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of .
the moon is kept in orbit , according to these ideas , because it roll@@ s along a valley in the cur@@ ved environment that the sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtu@@ e of their presence .
he , in fact -- there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim , he read a book , a tre@@ a@@ tise on swimming -- -- then do@@ ve into the ocean .
in detail , for instance , they couldn &apos;t get the mass of the electr@@ on to work out correc@@ tly in this theory .
it &apos;s built up of a huge number of these little tiny fil@@ am@@ ents of vi@@ br@@ ating energy , vi@@ br@@ ating in different frequ@@ en@@ cies .
this is a deep question .
and we think -- and this is , i think , very exciting -- that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions .
and one of those dots is the same in the two pan@@ els . okay ?
and if you haven &apos;t seen it yet , you &apos;re dead . right ?
there is no inher@@ ent meaning in information .
but i really want you to learn .
so you see it that way .
your brain doesn &apos;t know . because both are equally likely .
now remember -- -- she &apos;s supposed to be going to the blue flowers .
so not only can we create a pros@@ thetic for the visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red , but we can also investi@@ gate how people literally make sense of the world .
agreed ? yes ?
the question is , was it worth it ?
we &apos;ve developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .
because by definition , news is something that almost never happens .
or two , you can make people just feel secure and hope they don &apos;t notice .
in a primitive and simple world , there &apos;s really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality .
the two i &apos;m following are sur@@ vei@@ llan@@ ce cameras , id cards , quite a lot of our computer security models come from there .
so there was that feeling of lack of control .
compare that to the air@@ bag debate -- probably about 30 years behind .
and we rely on others . we rely on pro@@ x@@ ies .
but in the long-term , both feeling and reality are important .
it &apos;s not just reality ; it &apos;s feeling and reality .
self-@@ discipl@@ ine : the most important factor for success .
so we know she &apos;ll be successful . but we have to watch her .
so they elev@@ ated it .
so we said over a 20-@@ year time period , the value to the city in increased property values and increased ta@@ xes would be about 250 million .
but what really , i think , makes the high line special is the people .
another ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ gment we &apos;ve seen during these years , recent years , is that very few of these domesti@@ c inter@@ state , in@@ tra@@ state conflicts can be solved milit@@ arily .
when i first came to afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister , i met the com@@ man@@ der of is@@ a@@ f , the international tro@@ ops .
it &apos;s hard , but it is necessary .
but talking can be done in different ways .
i cannot do that unless i send the signals that i will be open to listen to the other side &apos;s signals .
the diplo@@ matic to@@ ol@@ box is actually full of different tools we can use to streng@@ then our communication .
so , literally , a few minutes before that , i down@@ lo@@ aded this scientific paper about calcu@@ lations on avi@@ an defe@@ cation , which is really quite interesting , because it turns out you can model this as something called &quot; po@@ is@@ eu@@ ille flow , &quot; and you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the avi@@ an rec@@ tum .
and somewhere along the line , somebody said , &quot; i know ! let &apos;s cut down the last tree and com@@ mit suicide , because we need more identical stat@@ ues . &quot;
so , i &apos;ll talk about it at a future ted .
but meta@@ materials are an incredibly exciting field .
so , another random thing i do is the search for ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al intelligence , or seti .
it sounds really dum@@ b , but that &apos;s what it is .
study of the ancient climate is very important .
the other interesting thing that i learned about whale sex : they cur@@ l their toes too .
and in particular , you &apos;ve probably all heard the analog@@ y that the genome is like the blue@@ print of your body , and if that were only true , it would be great , but it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s the one theory that the biologists ever really got right .
and so the trick is -- unfortunately , we don &apos;t have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome .
and as we did it , we realized this was the basic problem -- that taking the si@@ p of coffee -- that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to auto@@ mate this process like an assembly line and build robots that would measure prote@@ om@@ ics .
and if we find a pattern of things of the respon@@ ders to the drug , we see that in the blood , they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug .
and of course , it really doesn &apos;t have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system .
so david and i applied to this program and created a con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um at us@@ c where we &apos;ve got some of the best on@@ colo@@ gi@@ sts in the world and some of the best biologists in the world , from cold spring harb@@ or , stanford , au@@ stin -- i won &apos;t even go through and name all the places -- to have a research project that will last for five years where we &apos;re really going to try to build a model of cancer like this .
we &apos;ll go back a little more than a year .
that is in fact what great tri@@ b@@ al leaders do .
now , stage one , you &apos;ll notice , says , in effect , &quot; life su@@ cks . &quot;
stage three says , &quot; i &apos;m great . and you &apos;re not . &quot;
this is their lo@@ bby .
there was no road map . no one had ever done anything like this before .
in fact , martin lu@@ ther king &apos;s most famous line was at stage three .
i mean , if i was into box@@ ing , like they were , then my life wouldn &apos;t su@@ ck . but i don &apos;t . so it does .
they had people involved who were nobel lau@@ re@@ ates in economics , who reported being bor@@ ed .
the architect spent hundreds of hours designing the bur@@ nis@@ hed br@@ ass swi@@ tch@@ pl@@ ates for his new office tower .
why have we sett@@ led so quickly for the sound of its switch ?
as adults we admi@@ re the la@@ p from a no@@ stal@@ gic distance .
that &apos;s the end . thank you .
what are its kin@@ dre@@ d and component parts ?
he &apos;s been paraly@@ zed from the wa@@ ist down since he was 13 , in a car crash that killed his father and his sister .
there is , of course , a story behind the key moral lon@@ ging and comm@@ and@@ ment of ju@@ da@@ ism to repair the world -- ti@@ k@@ ku@@ n ol@@ am .
i want to show you the rest of this photograph , because this photograph is analog@@ ous to what we do to the word &quot; compassion &quot; in our culture -- we clean it up and we di@@ min@@ ish its dep@@ ths and its gro@@ unding in life , which is mess@@ y .
so i will par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase einstein in clo@@ sing and say that humanity , the future of humanity , needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terri@@ fying and won@@ dr@@ ous possibility of actually becoming one human race .
i felt as if the books needed me somehow , and they were calling out to me and i was for@@ sa@@ king them .
our most important institutions , our schools and our work@@ places , they are designed mostly for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts and for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts &apos; need for lots of stimulation .
and i often think that they have the best of all worlds .
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas fre@@ ed from the di@@ stor@@ tions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-@@ managed environment and take it from there .
so now i &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my su@@ it@@ case today .
and that &apos;s a lot harder for me , because as hon@@ ored as i am to be here with all of you right now , this is not my natural mi@@ lie@@ u .
or maybe they &apos;re full of cham@@ pagne glasses or sky@@ diving equipment .
my parents were fan@@ a@@ tics about learning , and i &apos;ll come back to that a little bit later .
the internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected .
we really think it &apos;s a phenomen@@ al driver of things , to force us to do things differently , and we look forward to being able to actually , working with so many partners around the world , to be able to reach that goal .
it &apos;s beginning to grow tremend@@ ously .
we expect this to be deplo@@ yed towards the end of this year , and we &apos;re very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education .
i &apos;m often asked , what surpris@@ es you about the book ?
i wanted to tell michael before he spoke that i really appreciate what he does , because it makes my life work a whole lot easier .
but everybody &apos;s got -- and i believe in a pl@@ ur@@ ali@@ stic society -- everybody &apos;s be@@ tting on something .
when he said the word &quot; species , &quot; he was reve@@ aling his world@@ view .
i know that &apos;s a stereot@@ ype . i &apos;ve never met one of them .
so , the good life is not about looking good , feeling good or having the goods ; it &apos;s about being good and doing good .
i want you to give me influence . &quot;
what &apos;s in your hand ?
first , it represented his identity .
and even though you &apos;re only going to be in the n@@ ba for a few years , you &apos;re going to be an n@@ ba player for the rest of your life .
some people have the mis@@ gui@@ ded idea that god only gets excited when you &apos;re doing , quote , &quot; spiritual things , &quot; like going to church or helping the poor , or , you know , conf@@ essing or doing something like that .
it &apos;s the minister of defense with whom we &apos;re working , not the minister of education , because it is seen as a strate@@ gic defense issue in the sense of liber@@ ating these z@@ ones that had been completely closed off , in which the people who had been causing , if you will , 40 years &apos; worth of bom@@ b@@ ings and ki@@ dna@@ pp@@ ings and ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ations lived .
you and i didn &apos;t have 10,000 books when we went to primary school .
right , the famous chinese character for pic@@ ni@@ c area .
you guys are answer@@ ing the question : how does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
we learn these really bad lessons really well .
but it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
it &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
and maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and move back to your home@@ town and raise a bunch of kids together .
bio@@ energy isn &apos;t global warming . bio@@ energy is something which seems counter@@ intuitive . bio@@ energy is oil . it &apos;s gas . it &apos;s coal . and part of building that bridge to the future , to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way , or put up these ge@@ o-@@ spa@@ tial or@@ bits that will t@@ wir@@ l or do micro@@ waves or stuff , is going to depend on how we understand bio@@ energy and manage it . and to do that , you really have to look first at agriculture .
so you take something like this , you burn it , you put it under pressure , and likely as not , you get this . although , again , i stress : we don &apos;t know .
last point , last graph . one of the things that we &apos;ve got to do is to stabili@@ ze oil prices . this is what oil prices look like , ok ?
her job , her goal and her calling was not to become the world &apos;s greatest toilet sc@@ rub@@ ber .
but unfortunately , he died pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely in 19@@ 70 , and so he wasn &apos;t really able to live that dream completely .
it was that sort of head@@ y question about what coun@@ ts that led me to take my ce@@ o hat off for a week and fly off to the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ an pe@@ aks .
wow , that &apos;s interesting .
i like it .
we &apos;re not asking anything that &apos;s in@@ tan@@ gible .
we don &apos;t have to choose between inspired employees and si@@ z@@ able prof@@ its , we can have both .
it &apos;s because perception is gro@@ unded in our experience .
so what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ certainty ?
but we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . it &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
it &apos;s forever fre@@ ely accessible by biology letters .
what &apos;s the point ? the point is what science does for us .
so oil and pe@@ tro@@ chemicals are not just a problem where there &apos;s a sp@@ ill ; they &apos;re a problem where there &apos;s not .
recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the in@@ cin@@ er@@ ation of the plastic , the burning of the plastic , which rele@@ ases incredible toxic chemicals and , once again , kill@@ s people .
but guess what ? you &apos;re so clever , but you &apos;re not as clever as a cla@@ m .
and so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement .
the press calls my particular vol@@ ant@@ or a &quot; sky@@ car . &quot;
but if you look at that top corner -- the highway system -- you see where we are today . high@@ ways are no longer being built , and that &apos;s a fact . you won &apos;t see any addi@@ tional high@@ ways in the next 10 years .
in this case here , we &apos;re flying it re@@ mot@@ ely , as we always did at the beginning .
if you want to stay alive you &apos;ve got to have bac@@ ku@@ ps .
paul m@@ oll@@ er talks about the future of personal air travel -- the marriage of autos and flight that will give us true freedom to travel off@@ -@@ road . he shows two things he &apos;s working on : the m@@ oll@@ er sky@@ car and a passen@@ ger-@@ friendly ho@@ vering dis@@ c .
they fall apart , they dis@@ integra@@ te , and they end up here .
number one question i get asked .
and what i &apos;m going to do is to show you pretty much what &apos;s here .
almost immediately , though , people ask , &quot; how small can you make this ? can you make this small enough ? &quot;
and think of what that would do for you .
so by trying to preser@@ ve our dead bodies , we den@@ y death , po@@ ison the living and further harm the environment .
once it &apos;s comple@@ ted , i plan to integra@@ te the infin@@ ity mush@@ rooms into a number of objects .
what a gift it was to the e@@ ager , young foreign correspon@@ dent that i was then .
and yet , he did not die .
there &apos;s another drug out there .
and they were re@@ adi@@ ly available .
just days before ter@@ ence died , his on@@ c@@ ologist said , &quot; tell ter@@ ence that better days are just ahead . &quot;
this is a poem about mark ant@@ ony .
what does this all mean for us ?
you can see the camera on the front . we collect multiple vie@@ w@@ points , van@@ tage points , an@@ gles , tex@@ tures . we bring all that data back in .
we think about the user interface .
in the last five years , the two countries have be@@ gun to conver@@ ge somewhat in economic growth .
and for the sa@@ ke of bre@@ vi@@ ty , i &apos;ll call one country country 1 and the other country country 2 .
the economy grows , government acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ates more resources , and the government can invest in infrastructure -- rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth .
the reason is you never go and bo@@ ther to ask the los@@ ers who also pur@@ ch@@ ased lot@@ tery ti@@ ckets and didn &apos;t end up winning the prize .
the gap between the two countries in terms of liter@@ acy is much more substan@@ tial than the data here indi@@ cated .
then the issue is , what about the chinese political system ?
why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster ?
this is the grand caf@@ e here in oxford .
we have this very rich vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary to describe moments of inspiration .
in the inside , it &apos;s all car parts .
what happened actually when dun@@ bar kind of looked at the tape is that , in fact , almost all of the important break@@ through ideas did not happen alone in the lab , in front of the microscope .
it will be useful in 20@@ 20 .
so these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal , and people start kind of coming into the office and saying , &quot; wow , that &apos;s pretty cool . can i hear ? wow , that &apos;s great . &quot;
and it &apos;s really hard to figure out how to get your mis@@ si@@ le so that it will land right on top of mos@@ cow , if you don &apos;t know where the sub@@ marine is in the middle of the pacific ocean .
today account for more than eight percent of the national income .
after all , no one is actually in fa@@ vor of cr@@ ony capitalism .
i love the internet . i love my mobile devices .
the result is something that economists al@@ an kru@@ e@@ ger and miles cor@@ ak call the great gat@@ s@@ by curve .
we created public education .
i kind of wo@@ ke up to this bit in the late &apos; 90s when i met this guy .
so we started to realize that we had a problem , and the problem is more serious because of this .
she &apos;s the one he &apos;s looking at , and &#91; she &apos;s &#93; the one he &apos;s coming for . can you see that ?
so that &apos;s the little idea .
peter sau@@ l : let &apos;s talk about dying
it wasn &apos;t until i entered high school that i thought , &quot; maybe now , you know -- being a big high school kid -- i can maybe become an active part of this big medical world . &quot;
it seems that cancer is a direct result to in@@ jury .
it &apos;s the part of cancer that is the most dangerous .
we use skelet@@ al muscles so much . it &apos;s the one portion of our body -- our heart &apos;s always be@@ ating . we &apos;re always moving our muscles .
but when the body is actually initi@@ ating a process and we &apos;re calling it a disease , it doesn &apos;t seem as though elimin@@ ation is the right solution . so even to go from there , it &apos;s possible , although far@@ -@@ fe@@ t@@ ched , that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy .
i had a sle@@ eping bag .
again , the first one to go to the black@@ board to answer questions .
and so , when i got outside , i actually gave the transl@@ ator some money and said , &quot; please go back and see if you can do something . &quot;
it was not a very nice area of se@@ ou@@ l , as there were mu@@ d streets outside of it .
a girl whose mother had been a prostit@@ ute , and she was a prostit@@ ute , and a boy who &apos;d been in and out of jail .
he had three women helping him take care of these kids .
this is a woman who is now working at the or@@ phan@@ age , whose son had been adopted .
we were just like , you know , ah , just full of ourselves .
this has got to be a night@@ m@@ are , this can &apos;t be happening .
it &apos;s so weird how life just goes on .
so , at this point , nat@@ asha doesn &apos;t speak a word of english , other than what little father ke@@ ene taught her .
ko@@ da@@ k hi@@ red nat@@ asha to be a transl@@ ator for them at the olymp@@ ics in korea .
he did that , literally , by replac@@ ing the earth with the sun in the center of the solar system , and then with this simp@@ le-@@ looking act , he actually launched a scientific and technological revolution , which many call the c@@ oper@@ ni@@ can revolution .
the way we do that , actually , is with a method , which we call the trans@@ it method .
but up until , literally , 15 years ago , that was all we knew about planets .
and we can find those that we would call habit@@ able , meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen .
and a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well .
you &apos;ve all learned that in school -- how small the earth is compared to the immen@@ se universe .
i mean look , you can see the ne@@ ck@@ tie , but you can &apos;t even imagine seeing the size of a little , small atom .
what we are showing here is -- on this axis here , i &apos;m showing percent of infected adults .
and it has -- the ste@@ ad@@ y state is , more or less , one percent of the adult world population is hiv-@@ infected .
it &apos;s not respe@@ ct@@ ful , and it &apos;s not very clever to think that way .
so , what is it then ?
but what we think is that it could be con@@ currency .
let &apos;s talk about billions .
now you can &apos;t just bl@@ ame this on im@@ peri@@ alism -- though many people have tried to do so -- for two reasons .
which leads me to think that neither geograph@@ y nor national character , popular explan@@ ations for this kind of thing , are really significant .
one , competition .
but at the end of it , you &apos;ve got a hundred ac@@ res of land .
any culture can get the work eth@@ ic if the institutions are there to create the in@@ cen@@ tive to work .
the first is , can you dele@@ te these apps , and are we in the process of doing so in the western world ?
no , we may hang on , despite the huge bur@@ dens of debt that we &apos;ve acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated , despite the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work eth@@ ic and other parts of our historical mo@@ jo .
ni@@ all , thank you .
spi@@ ders use silk for many pur@@ poses , including the tra@@ iling safety dra@@ gl@@ ine , wra@@ pping eggs for re@@ production , prote@@ ctive re@@ tre@@ ats and cat@@ ching pre@@ y .
and the most studied silk line of them all : major am@@ pul@@ late silk .
specifically , if you look on the vertical axis , that &apos;s stress . if you look at the maxim@@ um stress value for each of these fi@@ bers , you can see that there &apos;s a lot of variation , and in fact dra@@ gl@@ ine , or major am@@ pul@@ late silk , is the stron@@ gest of these fi@@ bers .
sc@@ y@@ to@@ des doesn &apos;t use a web at all to catch pre@@ y . instead , sc@@ y@@ to@@ des sort of l@@ ur@@ ks around and wa@@ its for pre@@ y to get close to it , and then im@@ mobili@@ zes pre@@ y by spra@@ ying a sil@@ k-@@ like ven@@ om onto that inse@@ ct .
and a coordin@@ ation cost is essentially all of the financial or institu@@ tional difficul@@ ties in ar@@ ran@@ ging group output .
so , i was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tag@@ ged &quot; mer@@ ma@@ id par@@ ade . &quot; there were 3,@@ 100 photos taken by 1@@ 18 photogra@@ pher@@ s , all ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated and then put under this nice , ne@@ at name , shown in reverse chron@@ ological order .
you ar@@ range the coordin@@ ation in the group , and by doing that you get the same outcome , without the institu@@ tional difficul@@ ties .
and by the time we get around here , we get ten or fewer photos , and then there &apos;s this long , flat tail .
the institu@@ tional response is , i can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hir@@ es -- great , that &apos;s what i &apos;ll do .
the bigger question is , what do you do about the value down here ?
this is so much more important than x@@ box , but it &apos;s a lot less gli@@ tz@@ y .
pro-@@ ana , the pro-@@ ana groups .
and that &apos;s going to happen one ar@@ ena at a time , one institution at a time . the forces are general , but the results are going to be specific .
and -- and you can get somebody to eat something that &apos;s good for them once , but they won &apos;t eat it again if they don &apos;t like it , right ?
we have to develop the gl@@ uten .
three transforma@@ tions take place in the o@@ ven .
because what happens is , bread begins as whe@@ at or any other grain .
i &apos;d call that radical .
it &apos;s still d@@ ough . nobody e@@ ats bread d@@ ough -- a few people do , i think , but not too many .
but we &apos;ve got this bread , and what i did here is to try to , again , ev@@ o@@ ke even more fla@@ vor from this grain , was we &apos;ve added into it the spent grain from be@@ er-@@ making .
just now i was func@@ tioning in the role of the interpre@@ ter , and there i am , interpre@@ ter .
okay ?
i can also understand that sort of impli@@ cit cri@@ tic@@ ism in this piece , &quot; s-@@ to@@ g , &quot; which i made when i was living in cop@@ enhagen .
i was a bit mis@@ chie@@ v@@ ous . in fact , to make it more interesting , i put a space right in here , and this is the actual title of the piece .
if you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psych@@ ologists , would have said that this baby was ir@@ rational , il@@ logical , e@@ go@@ cent@@ ric -- that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
so the question is : what would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
so they &apos;re very , very good at pe@@ cking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
we don &apos;t have to do anything . all we have to do is learn .
because after all , if you ask even grow@@ nu@@ ps about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
here &apos;s one from cri@@ st@@ ine leg@@ are &apos;s lab .
so when you put four .
so when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
and what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game .
so , that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to simu@@ late -- not chris specifically , i should say , but humans in general .
so , what you &apos;ll see in a moment is a very simple bi@@ ped that &apos;s learning how to walk using artificial evolution .
i should add that it &apos;s very simple to add things like hair , clothes , etc . , but what we &apos;ve done here is use a very simple visu@@ alization , so you can concent@@ rate on the movement .
again , a push , now this time from the front .
now , here &apos;s another one .
now , i &apos;m showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel , how reali@@ stic it can look .
but i particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds , like there , for example , that tom mel@@ cher has shown us .
he &apos;s actually a better dan@@ cer than i am , i have to say .
you can draw , as everyone should .
you know the hin@@ dus are killing us muslims . be careful . &quot;
i &apos;ve called for tech support again .
one time i wrote a colum@@ n about my efforts to reach d@@ ell technical support , and within 12 hours there were 700 messages from rea@@ ders on the feedback boards on the times website , from users saying , &quot; me too ! &quot; and , &quot; here &apos;s my tale of wo@@ e . &quot; i call it &quot; software ra@@ ge . &quot;
and the techni@@ cian &apos;s like , &quot; ma &apos;@@ am , you &apos;ve got the mouse up against the screen ? &quot;
where are you going to stick them ? you only have so many design tools .
but i be@@ g of the designers here to break all those rules if they viol@@ ate the biggest rule of all , which is intelligence . now what do i mean by that ?
on the opposite side of the monitor , a task bar appears , and somewhere in those links -- by the way , not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new docum@@ ent .
they &apos;re dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh , but they can &apos;t . they &apos;re locked in because so many ad@@ d-@@ ons and other company stuff lo@@ cks into the old 198@@ 2 ch@@ as@@ sis .
the other products were bac@@ ked by microsoft with an open standard , not apple &apos;s pro@@ pri@@ et@@ y standard .
and conver@@ sely , if somebody sen@@ ds me hate mail -- which happens daily -- i say , &quot; p@@ iss off . &quot;
and so very simple things -- off@@ -@@ the-@@ shel@@ f technologies that we could easily find on the th@@ en-@@ early web -- would clearly make a huge difference to that problem .
we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal .
but i wanted to share with you three areas that i &apos;m particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that i was talking about in the wired article .
and i want to give you a specific example of a new material that was discovered 15 years ago .
new ways of making electric transportation .
so if we can address , use technology , help address education , help address the environment , help address the pande@@ mic , does that solve the larger problem that i was talking about in the wired article ? and i &apos;m afraid the answer is really no , because you can &apos;t solve a problem with the management of technology with more technology .
and what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information .
and i &apos;m a product of that generation , like so many other of my peers .
it &apos;s going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planet@@ ary systems that can possibly support it .
so why might it be hard to find ?
so , it &apos;s a very ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous environment , with co as well , and many other g@@ ases .
these organisms we now bring into the lab , and you can see some of them growing on pe@@ tr@@ i pl@@ ates , and get them to re@@ produce the precise biom@@ in@@ er@@ als that we find on the walls of these ca@@ ves .
and one of the best ways to study something without cont@@ amin@@ ating it is to have an inter@@ medi@@ ary .
did it start there and get transpor@@ ted here ?
198@@ 2 , peter g@@ oll@@ wi@@ tzer wrote a whole book about this and in 2009 , he did some new tests that were published .
it &apos;s bu@@ ried treas@@ ure .
he wanted to make that which was expensive free .
and normally in a book , you wouldn &apos;t worry about the little bits , but these little bits might con@@ tain unique archi@@ me@@ des text .
how were we going to do that ?
well one of the unique texts in archi@@ me@@ des is called &quot; the sto@@ mach@@ ion . &quot;
he lived for another 10 years , then the ma@@ ce@@ don@@ ian fac@@ tion caught up with him .
under a creative common@@ s license .
in 198@@ 5 , he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery .
i was really happy when i was done .
when i took the tour , it actually inclu@@ ded some op@@ us one , i was gla@@ d to see .
even the people who market these clu@@ bs -- i mean , they &apos;ll say these have four axis sha@@ fts which mini@@ mi@@ ze loss of club speed and there@@ by drive the ball far@@ ther -- but they &apos;ll say , look , you know , you &apos;re not getting 5@@ 7@@ ,000 dollars worth of performance from these clu@@ bs .
i mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet .
there was one object that i could not get my hands on , and that was the 194@@ 7 ch@@ ev@@ al blan@@ c .
and i don &apos;t -- call my pal@@ ate a phili@@ st@@ ine pal@@ ate -- so it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean something that i wasn &apos;t impres@@ sed , but i was not the only one there who had that reaction .
this is a scre@@ en@@ shot from the virtual game world , ent@@ ro@@ pi@@ a universe .
but this isn &apos;t the really interesting stuff .
it keeps people engaged .
they think this game is un@@ fair .
you don &apos;t pun@@ ish failure . you reward every little bit of effort -- a little bit of gold , a little bit of credit . you &apos;ve done 20 questions -- ti@@ ck .
the word &quot; addi@@ ction &quot; is thrown around .
we can use calcul@@ ated random@@ ness .
but there are a lot of challenges for this .
and we also found bacteria that normally in@@ hab@@ it the gut .
it &apos;s so simple , and we thought , you know , okay , it costs between 20 and 50 bucks to provide school feeding for a year .
and agriculture is where food comes from .
but people do because it &apos;s so cheap , and so our whole food system in the last 30 years has really shif@@ ted .
and i think by al@@ ig@@ ning international advo@@ c@@ ates that are add@@ res@@ sing hunger and domesti@@ c advo@@ c@@ ates that are add@@ res@@ sing obesity , we might actually look for long-term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone .
we can only bl@@ ame ourselves . over the last 50 years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more li@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous .
and then only after this is done are you allowed to do this , begin to put forward architectural mani@@ fe@@ stations that mani@@ fest those positions .
why was this horrible little building so important to their ren@@ own and their innovation ?
but there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected .
it is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in fa@@ vor of the hand of the artistic director .
here you see the various ac@@ ou@@ stic ba@@ ff@@ les as well as the flying mechanis@@ ms and cat@@ walks over the audi@@ tor@@ ium .
it &apos;s actually beautiful . there was a rock band .
this is a picture of me from a very aw@@ k@@ ward stage in my life .
one such project is about a year and a half old .
so i &apos;ll show you now some of my favorite mon@@ tages from &quot; we feel fine . &quot;
so i went up there , and i lived with these guys out in their wh@@ aling camp here , and photographed the entire experience , beginning with the tax@@ i ride to ne@@ war@@ k airport in new york , and ending with the bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ing of the second whale , seven and a half days later .
this is my studio in brooklyn . this is the arctic ocean , and the bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ing of the second whale , seven days later .
these whales are about 40 feet long , and weigh@@ ing over 40 tons . and they provide the food source for the community for much of the year .
he was playing cop@@ s and rob@@ bers with his friends , running around town , his wish was to become a police offic@@ er .
but all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life , like other people .
her wish was to make a pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge to ti@@ bet .
you &apos;re most welcome .
he &apos;s got the over@@ stu@@ ff@@ ed lea@@ ther sat@@ chel and the rec@@ tan@@ g@@ ular fi@@ le case and a laptop bag and the t@@ we@@ ed jac@@ ket with the lea@@ ther pat@@ ches , and — — he looks at them , and then in a blin@@ k of an eye , he k@@ ne@@ els down in front of them , and he starts to say , &quot; you know , listen , here &apos;s how you can do it . look , if you do this -- &quot; and he takes the lac@@ es out of their hand , and inst@@ antly , he starts t@@ ying these kn@@ ots , and even better than they were doing it , remark@@ ably .
and in those days , my hair was down to my wa@@ ist , i drove a motor@@ cycle , i was un@@ married , i owned a bar , so those were different times .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re probably gene@@ tically speci@@ fied for .
the point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing .
this is an actual text that was done by a non-@@ male person of about 20 years old not too long ago .
s@@ las@@ h is used in a very different way in tex@@ ting among young people today .
you can go even further back .
and many of you out there are the heads of ma@@ cro@@ media and microsoft , and in a way those are my ban@@ e : i think there &apos;s a great homo@@ geni@@ zing force that software im@@ poses on people and limits the way they think of course , it &apos;s also a great liber@@ ating force that makes possible , you know , publi@@ shing and so forth , and standards , and so on .
how has this happened ?
if the al-@@ q@@ ae@@ da base was to be establi@@ shed near g@@ ha@@ z@@ n@@ i , we would hit them very hard , and it would be very , very difficult for the taliban to protect them .
and the reason i &apos;m looking a little bit per@@ ple@@ x@@ ed in this photograph is i was somewhat frighten@@ ed , and i was too afraid on this occasi@@ on to ask him , having run for an hour through the desert and taken refu@@ ge in this house , why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me .
or in 2008 , major general cham@@ po@@ u@@ x to come in and say he would deliver the &quot; decisi@@ ve year . &quot;
so we need to change that institu@@ tional culture .
one of the sad@@ dest things about our invol@@ vement in afghanistan is that we &apos;ve got our pri@@ orities out of syn@@ c .
just briefly , what &apos;s your take on the current events there and the intervention ?
so , the technology that i want to talk about is for the third world , for the developing world , but it has , i think , much bro@@ a@@ der application , because information is so important in the healthcare system .
why do we choose paper ?
so , it works very well there , but it doesn &apos;t work very well when you need more quanti@@ ta@@ tive information .
do they have a common cold ?
you don &apos;t have to send out a doctor , you send out somebody who can just take the sample , and in the clinic either a doctor , or ide@@ ally a computer in this case , does the analysis .
and in this particular case we were just interested in the repli@@ c@@ ability of that .
it meas@@ ures the absor@@ ption of light in a sample the ne@@ at thing about this is , you have light source that fli@@ ckers on and off at about 1,000 her@@ tz , another light source that dete@@ cts that light at 1,000 her@@ tz , and so you can run this system in bro@@ ad day@@ light .
in the south , in the nor@@ the@@ ast , almost everywhere but with a couple of ex@@ ceptions here and there .
in deci@@ ding your vote for president today , was the race we &apos;re looking for people that said , &quot; yes , race was a factor ; mor@@ e@@ over it was an important factor , in my decision , &quot; and people who voted for john mc@@ ca@@ in as a result of that factor , maybe in combination with other factors , and maybe alone .
so it &apos;s the combination of these two things : it &apos;s education and the type of neighbors that you have , which we &apos;ll talk about more in a moment .
just based on who lives in your immedi@@ ate neighborhood around you .
but the point is , this is all good news , because when something is predictable , it is what i call design@@ able .
since we &apos;re in e@@ din@@ burgh , i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ an do@@ yle .
and finally , she has a der@@ mati@@ tis on the fingers of her right hand , a der@@ mati@@ tis that is unique to the lin@@ o@@ le@@ um factory workers in bur@@ n@@ tis@@ land . &quot;
this is a very famous painting : &quot; the doctor &quot; by lu@@ ke fil@@ des .
now i &apos;ve been influ@@ enced in this thinking by two an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es that i want to share with you .
there was just no way .
and they helped me understand that ritu@@ als are all about transformation .
and as i wondered what he was up to , his stick fingers made their way up to his pa@@ j@@ ama shirt , f@@ um@@ bling with his butt@@ ons .
i &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
so that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
there &apos;s nothing more to it than that .
it wasn &apos;t till -- hu@@ y@@ gens had two things .
he char@@ ged five bucks a head to come see the nun bu@@ n till he got a ce@@ as@@ e-@@ and-@@ des@@ ist from mother ter@@ es@@ a &apos;s lawyer .
there &apos;s a rever@@ s@@ espe@@ ech@@ .com web page from which i down@@ lo@@ aded this stuff .
and so , he wrote an op@@ -@@ ed piece in &quot; the guar@@ dian &quot; about kat@@ ie &apos;s song , in which he said , well , we know exactly how old , how far from the edge .
and so if we can do that , then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating aids and hiv and malaria and for pre@@ venting avi@@ an flu . thank you .
but that hospital was over four hours away , and se@@ vi@@ th@@ a didn &apos;t have the means to get there , so her baby died .
in doing this , i believe we can truly bring technology to the mas@@ ses .
first , about a guy named na@@ than win@@ ogra@@ d .
we started with the factory idea : that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could chur@@ n out change .
the quick little diagram of it is , you &apos;re up here , and you are pushing it out to the world .
not because you force them to do something against their will , but because they wanted to connect .
but let me just try a couple .
what it requires , as ger@@ al@@ d@@ ine car@@ ter has discovered , is to be able to say , &quot; i can &apos;t do this by myself .
and the people he surro@@ unds himself with need the connection .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .
essentially first , the protein would have to be found in all pan@@ crea@@ tic can@@ cers at high levels in the bloo@@ d@@ stream in the earli@@ est stages , but also only in cancer .
and — then reality took hold , and over the course of a month , i got 19@@ 9 reje@@ ctions out of those 200 e@@ mails .
for me , it &apos;s all about looking at the internet in an entirely new way to realize that there &apos;s so much more to it than just po@@ sting du@@ ck-@@ face pictures of yourself online .
she was preser@@ ved by mo@@ dest@@ y of the religion she was ad@@ or@@ ned by the light of the qu@@ ran sher@@ e@@ en el fe@@ ki : 4@@ sh@@ ba@@ b has been du@@ b@@ bed islamic m@@ tv .
we &apos;re not talking here about a clas@@ h of civili@@ zations .
so what susta@@ ins desire , and why is it so difficult ?
in desire , we want a bridge to cross .
wanting them is one thing . nee@@ ding them is a shu@@ t@@ down , and women have known that forever , because anything that will bring up par@@ en@@ tho@@ od will usually decre@@ ase the ero@@ tic charge .
we can experience that powerful thing called antici@@ pation , which is a mor@@ t@@ ar to desire , the ability to imagine it , as if it &apos;s happening , to experience it as if it &apos;s happening , while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time .
so i want to draw that little image for you , because this need to recon@@ ci@@ le these two sets of needs , we are born with that .
on the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go .
this is not talking heads , in the picture anyway .
the music works perfectly in that setting .
this is the opera house that wa@@ g@@ ner built for himself .
according to scott j@@ op@@ lin , the b@@ ands were playing on ri@@ ver@@ bo@@ ats and clu@@ bs .
there &apos;s live music , and there &apos;s recorded music .
there &apos;s one other kind of new ven@@ ue , the private mp@@ 3 player .
but this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
i hope that you won &apos;t feel that these few moments with me is not a -- is an an@@ tic@@ li@@ ma@@ x , after all these tremendous talks that you &apos;ve heard , and add@@ res@@ ses , which i in@@ tend to listen to every one of them .
but about two centuries before david , the hit@@ ti@@ tes had discovered the secret of sm@@ el@@ ting and processing of iron , and , slowly , that skill spread .
we can &apos;t get along with other people , even in our own families .
we are a soul .
writing the oldest book in the world was job , and he said , &quot; man is born un@@ to trouble as the spar@@ ks fly up@@ ward . &quot;
technology projects the my@@ th of control over our mortality .
she said he never thought of god , never talked about god , didn &apos;t believe in god . he was an athei@@ st .
bla@@ ise pas@@ cal asked exactly that question in se@@ vent@@ e@@ enth@@ -@@ century france .
it can be yours , as well , as you seek the living god and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future .
&quot; what i will &quot; i will not dance to your war dr@@ um .
this he@@ art@@ beat is lou@@ der than death .

one woman no longer belie@@ ves love will ever find her .
poet su@@ hei@@ r ham@@ mad per@@ forms two spin@@ e-@@ t@@ ing@@ ling spo@@ ken@@ -@@ word pieces : &quot; what i will &quot; and &quot; break &quot; -- medi@@ tations on war and peace , on women and power . wait for the astonishing line : &quot; do not fear what has blo@@ wn up . if you must , fear the un@@ explo@@ ded . &quot;
the night before i left , she came to the room and said , &quot; le@@ y@@ ma@@ h , don &apos;t leave me here .
countries like america , we &apos;ve heard things like no child left behind .
she takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school .
we set up a foundation .
all of these girls went to the gold mine , and they were pre@@ domin@@ antly prostit@@ utes doing other things .
the surprise came at the end . who won ?
it dis@@ plays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called &quot; meaningful ad@@ jac@@ ency . &quot;
and so while computers alone can catch all but the cle@@ ver@@ est frau@@ d@@ sters , cat@@ ching the cle@@ ver@@ est is the difference between success and failure .
the fri@@ ction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an oper@@ ational time frame using humans , p@@ d@@ fs and ten@@ ac@@ ity alone .
i &apos;d like all of you to pause for a moment , you w@@ re@@ t@@ ched wea@@ kl@@ ings , and take stock of your miser@@ able existence .
i &apos;m talking about all companies .
how often do you think i have that day ?
but an inci@@ dent that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective .
the area also has one of the lo@@ west rati@@ os of parks to people in the city .
and we all pay de@@ arly for solid waste costs , health problems associated with pollution and more o@@ di@@ ously , the cost of im@@ pris@@ oning our young black and lat@@ in@@ o men , who pos@@ s@@ ess un@@ told amounts of un@@ ta@@ pped potential .
in new york state , robert mo@@ ses spe@@ ar@@ headed an aggressi@@ ve highway expansion campaign .
we se@@ cu@@ red 20 million dollars to build fir@@ st-@@ phase projects .
in the post-@@ kat@@ r@@ ina era , we have still more in common .
ours is a city , not a wil@@ der@@ ness preser@@ ve . and i &apos;ve embra@@ ced my inner capit@@ alist .
use your influence in support of com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive sustainable change everywhere .
i thought , why don &apos;t i make her an interactive mother &apos;s day card using the scratch software that i &apos;d been developing with my research group at the mit media lab ?
by writing , be creating these interactive mother &apos;s day cards , these kids were showing that they were really flu@@ ent with new technologies .
but co@@ ding doesn &apos;t have to be like this .
because as they learn to code , it en@@ ables them to learn many other things , opens up many new opportunities for learning .
and he saw this , and he was so excited , he reached his hand out to me , and he said , &quot; thank you , thank you , thank you . &quot;
let me end with just one more example .
cars are a sculpture -- did you know this ?
it &apos;s that same kind of commitment , that same kind of beauty .
i think this one here , there &apos;s a pop song that really describes phili@@ ppe star@@ ck for me , you know , this is like you know , this is like pu@@ pp@@ y love , you know , this is cool right ?
you know , that &apos;s what i have to do sometimes .
and one of the young women in the project , she was a fantastic lady , she actually built her room in the ba@@ th@@ room .
we spent four hours being told all about vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary that needs to be built between engineers and designers .
this cannot be . &quot;
we know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever before .
and those post-@@ it notes invol@@ ve this and other proteins of its class -- so-called bro@@ mo@@ do@@ ma@@ ins .
and he ob@@ li@@ ged us .
what this research taught us -- not just my lab , but our institute , and harvard medical school more generally -- is that we have unique resources in acade@@ mi@@ a for drug discovery -- that our center that has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other , never made one of its own .
and one thing i &apos;ve learned in boston is that you people will do anything for cancer -- and i love that .
so we say the universe is expanding .
bol@@ tz@@ mann gave us a formul@@ a -- en@@ gra@@ ved on his tom@@ b@@ stone now -- that really quanti@@ fi@@ es what entrop@@ y is .
in every one of these books , every one of these sets of lec@@ tures , he em@@ ph@@ asi@@ zed this puzzle : why did the early universe have such a small entrop@@ y ?
einstein was f@@ ond of this idea .
so bol@@ tz@@ mann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in ther@@ mal equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
and the predictions are that the flu@@ ctu@@ ations that make us are mini@@ mal .
that empty space la@@ sts essentially forever .
my bold spe@@ cu@@ lation is that i will be absolutely v@@ indi@@ cated by history .
all sisters , ex@@ cep@@ ting me .
so i decided i would build one wind@@ mill for myself .
there are an enormous number of them that we use every day .
then i thought , &quot; why not make a google map , but in the physical world ? &quot;
whatever you &apos;re doing with your hands , it &apos;s understanding that gest@@ ure .
the fun part is , i &apos;m going to the boston me@@ tr@@ o , and playing a pon@@ g game inside the train on the ground , right ?
thank you .
that &apos;s fantastic .
and really , this is the reason i came here tonight .
so moving to our second comm@@ and@@ ment that i wanted to show you .
in this present time today , we only carry 18 percent of our population in high-@@ capacity transportation .
bring infrastructure to the fa@@ vel@@ as , to the slums , wherever you are .
so o@@ sor@@ i@@ o , good to be there with you .
we have gps &apos;s in all of our trucks .
now this is an extremely complicated subject , in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different .
and it should take into account what we know of the aes@@ thetic interests of isol@@ ated h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ er b@@ ands that survi@@ ved into the 19th and the 20th centuries .
people in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape , a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pl@@ ei@@ sto@@ c@@ ene sa@@ van@@ n@@ as where we evolved .
and the plot really thi@@ ck@@ ens when you realize that , unlike other pl@@ ei@@ sto@@ c@@ ene tools , the hand ax@@ es often exhi@@ bit no evidence of wear on their deli@@ cate bla@@ de ed@@ ges .
no , it &apos;s deep in our minds .
but the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment , in a flat , clo@@ se@@ d-@@ off parking lot -- even the lan@@ es defined by red traffic con@@ es .
another device is called spe@@ ed@@ stri@@ p .
he &apos;s coming up to the grand@@ stand , fellow feder@@ ation@@ ists .
but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the sp@@ in-@@ off technology that can come from this project .
it was neu@@ tral , im@@ passi@@ ve and even , after a while , str@@ angel@@ y compan@@ i@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , although i did notice that its cal@@ m ex@@ teri@@ or sometimes sli@@ pped and that it occasi@@ onally mir@@ r@@ ored my own un@@ expres@@ sed emotion .
well , you have to go over and po@@ ur it over him in front of the other students . &quot;
i would set boundaries for the voices , and try to interact with them in a way that was as@@ ser@@ tive yet respe@@ ct@@ ful , establi@@ shing a slow process of communication and collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another .
we are unique . we are ir@@ replac@@ e@@ able .
when people have this technology in their hands , you have a do@@ -@@ it-@@ yourself biot@@ e@@ ch k@@ it , grow your own -- grow your dog , grow your own cat .
so if life could be establi@@ shed out there , it would have all the essen@@ ti@@ als -- chemistry and sunlight -- everything that &apos;s needed .
there &apos;s a long history in astronom@@ y of unlikely things turning out to be there . and i mean , the fin@@ est example of that was radio astronom@@ y as a whole .
so these creatures will be bright against the cold surro@@ und@@ ings .
that would be a fun thing to do .
and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley , so i wanted to be there , and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes , that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes .
so , we had to design both the light and the light bul@@ b .
and it &apos;s what i call being design driven .
but when ni@@ chol@@ as ne@@ gro@@ po@@ nte -- and he has spoken about this project a lot , he &apos;s the fo@@ under of ol@@ pc -- came to us about two and a half years ago , there were some clear ideas .
it &apos;s actually just launched , actually launched on val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s day , febru@@ ary 14 , about 10 days ago .
and i was on a college cho@@ ir tour up in northern california , and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus , and we were rela@@ x@@ ing next to this beautiful i@@ dy@@ lli@@ c lake in the mountains .
com@@ pos@@ er and conduc@@ tor eric whit@@ ac@@ re has inspired millions by bringing together &quot; virtual cho@@ irs , &quot; sing@@ ers from many countries spli@@ ced together on video . now , for the first time ever , he creates the experience in real time , as 32 sing@@ ers from around the world sk@@ ype in to join an on@@ stage cho@@ ir for an epi@@ c performance of whit@@ ac@@ re &apos;s &quot; clou@@ d@@ bur@@ st , &quot; based on a poem by oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o pa@@ z .
but you &apos;re young , you could still try again . &quot;
she walked into my office at a time when no one knew where afghanistan was in the united states .
she shr@@ u@@ gs when i ask her about safety .
bos@@ ni@@ ans , cro@@ ats and ser@@ bs find a rare shared space of pri@@ de in their history , and les@@ b@@ or re@@ minds them that the songs one group often cla@@ ims as thei@@ rs alone really bel@@ ong to them all .
in a now famous c@@ nn clip , you can see them sitting on the ground , their arms linked .
and in most parts of the world , that top is still controlled by men .
i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p@@ .@@ o. box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in facebook , in tex@@ ting or cell phones in general .
we still clu@@ tch close these letters to our chest , to the words that speak lou@@ der than loud , when we turn pages into pal@@ et@@ tes to say the things that we have needed to say , the words that we have needed to write , to sisters and brothers and even to strangers , for far too long .
you put it in your search engine , and you create the drug to treat the threat .
&quot; it &apos;s funny , &quot; i said to myself , &quot; you can m@@ ing@@ le with the opposite sex at the hol@@ y ka@@ ab@@ a , but not at the burger king . &quot;
and west@@ ern@@ ers , europe@@ ans or americans , who didn &apos;t know about this before faced this practice within some of the muslim communities who migr@@ ated from north africa .
maybe it &apos;s a problem of the political culture , and we have to think about how to change that political culture . &quot;
but not just that ; also democracy , par@@ li@@ ament , the idea of repres@@ entation , the idea of equal citi@@ zen@@ ship .
you have anti-@@ coloni@@ zation .
and thanks to that , tur@@ key has been able to reas@@ on@@ ably create a success story in which islam and the most pi@@ ous under@@ stand@@ ings of islam have become part of the democratic game , and even contribu@@ tes to the democratic and economic adv@@ ance of the country .
and that &apos;s because today we can see what &apos;s inside of the brain , rather than just looking at its overall shape .
but one of the most popular ones involves green flu@@ ores@@ cent protein .
today i want to talk to you about ethni@@ c conflict and civil war .
but this trend is less un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous .
but for many parts of africa , a colleague of mine once put it this way , &quot; the ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fire on tu@@ es@@ day night was reached just in time for the geno@@ cide to start on we@@ dn@@ es@@ day morning . &quot;
yet instead of gras@@ ping this opportunity , local and international leaders soon dis@@ engaged and became di@@ stra@@ cted by the second inti@@ fa@@ da , the events of 9 / 11 and the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
third , institu@@ tional design .
going down there was like enter@@ ing a time cap@@ su@@ le , and i came out with a different sense of myself in time .
these are di@@ atoms , sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton with skelet@@ ons of silicon ...
and others fly today like e@@ cho@@ es of the past .
her@@ d safety came with shar@@ pen@@ ed senses .
in this stun@@ ning sli@@ des@@ how , celebr@@ ated nature photographer fr@@ ans lan@@ ting pres@@ ents the life project , a poe@@ tic collection of photographs that tell the story of our planet , from its er@@ up@@ tive beginn@@ ings to its present diversity . so@@ und@@ track by philip glass .
so we started thinking about that , and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer .
let me tell you that there &apos;s not too many people interested in invest@@ ing in that , not even the pro@@ state cancer foundation , who we &apos;d raised about 1.@@ 2 million dollars for at that stage .
last year we had 4@@ 50,000 mo bro@@ s spread across the world and together we raised 7@@ 7 million dollars .
and from that moment i realized that mov@@ ember is so much more than a mu@@ sta@@ che , having a joke .
thank you .
eight years later , when he was a young man of 18 , ben@@ ki left the forest for the first time .
we &apos;re running out of land .
san@@ gh@@ am@@ it@@ ra comes from bang@@ al@@ ore .
he &apos;s a leaders &apos; quest fellow , and that helps him with his work .
because he thought a nation should never repe@@ at the mistakes of the past .
so i think we need suc@@ c@@ ession planning on a global basis .
it &apos;s per@@ ceptions , thoughts , feelings , dreams .
and the gy@@ m@@ no@@ sop@@ h@@ ist answer@@ ed , &quot; i &apos;m experi@@ encing no@@ th@@ ing@@ ness . &quot;
he heard a very different story .
you dun@@ k it in the river .
take a look .
so , it &apos;s rapidly changing , highly diverse , cha@@ otic , ambi@@ gu@@ ous , un@@ predictable .
and there are more than 200 forma@@ ts , across 50 cities and to@@ w@@ ns of india .
and based on this , we created a ritual for leaders .
de@@ v@@ du@@ tt pat@@ tan@@ ai@@ k takes an eye@@ -@@ opening look at the my@@ ths of india and of the west -- and shows how these two fundamentally different sets of beliefs about god , death and heaven help us consi@@ st@@ ently mis@@ understand one another .
&quot; and now i know i am completely compe@@ tent . &quot;
and what , what are you trying to tell me ? that you — &quot; &quot; well , i have an interest . &quot;
&quot; i love you more than — &quot; all right ! she left the room hal@@ f@@ way through his en@@ um@@ er@@ ation of his love for her .
what a wi@@ mp .
you could have said , looked the kid in the face , and said , &quot; go for it , kid , just like i did . &quot;
if you don &apos;t , you &apos;re not alone .
but that very fact is telling .
there have been surprisingly few innovations , until digital mammo@@ graphy was appro@@ ved in 2000 .
so if you will allow me a little creative license , i will tell you the story of the ser@@ en@@ di@@ pit@@ ous colli@@ sion of my patient &apos;s problem with a physicist &apos;s solution .
but m@@ bi explo@@ its the different molecular behavior of tumors , and therefore , it &apos;s im@@ per@@ vi@@ ous to breast density .
we had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose , and we have spent the last three years making modi@@ fi@@ cations to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this .
i was at a conference of 6@@ 0,000 people in bre@@ ast@@ -@@ imaging last week in chicago , and i was stun@@ ned that there was a he@@ ated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is .
that is the word that comes to mind .
i know what you like . i know who you are , and that &apos;s even before i look at your mail or your phone .
you &apos;d think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn &apos;t be such su@@ ckers just for the pretty phones .
or maybe we pun@@ t -- ask the legal department , see what they say .
that &apos;s true no matter what thing you &apos;re talking about .
maybe there &apos;s another way that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework .
maybe you think , it &apos;s his phone .
you can &apos;t just take human thinking and put it into a machine .
not right now . wait till i finish talking .
we care what happens in &quot; apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se now . &quot;
marketing redu@@ ces things . marketing simpli@@ fi@@ es .
so in order to make this white noise a little bit active and re@@ active , i create a ball , a rolling ball able to analy@@ ze and find where does aggressi@@ ve sound come from , and roll , at home or at work , towards aggressi@@ ve noise , and em@@ its white noise in order to neutr@@ alize it .
and this object knows , better than you and probably before you , what you really need .
this one is an antibio@@ tic .
in this gu@@ ise of living object approach , i like the idea of a kind of invisible design , as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves .
so it &apos;s , for me , a great product .
indeed , this object is a domesti@@ c farm , for fis@@ hes and green .
see , like this one ?
so before i do that , just one war@@ ning , which is that this presentation has been r@@ ated &apos; r &apos; by the motion picture association of america .
and it was a perfect drug . you could sell for -- buy the coca@@ ine that went into it for a dollar , sell it for five dollars .
but he he@@ ars some voices up in the sta@@ ir@@ well , so he clim@@ bs up the sta@@ ir@@ well .
we got an inside look at the gang , from the very bottom up to the very top .
so what do the wa@@ ges look like ? so you might be surprised .
now to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during cra@@ ck -- and i &apos;m not really focusing on the nega@@ tives , but really , there &apos;s another story to tell you there -- if you look at the death rates -- just of random , young black males growing up in the inner city in the united states -- the death rates during cra@@ ck were about one percent .
it goes back to , you know , the re@@ al-@@ real versus the fa@@ ke@@ -@@ real .
he says , &quot; if we start shooting around there , &quot; -- in the other gang &apos;s terri@@ tory -- &quot; nobody , and , i mean , you dig it , nobody , going to step on their tur@@ f .
you can imagine with this big surface of a sky@@ sur@@ fing board , there is a lot of force , a lot of power .
of course you need to be in physical , very good , condition , so i &apos;m training a lot .
coming off of you ?
and i have an academy , a part of the university of fine arts in berlin .
and what happens is that people , they start to see themselves in this space .
it makes a difference whether you say , &quot; i &apos;m a part of this city .
the small mountains in the fore@@ ground , they move more .
how do we create an idea which is both toler@@ ant to individu@@ ality , and also to colle@@ ctivity , without pol@@ ari@@ zing the two into two different op@@ pos@@ ites ?
in 2010 , there was a ted event called mission blue held abo@@ ard the lin@@ d@@ bla@@ d explor@@ er in the gala@@ pa@@ gos as part of the ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment of sylvia ear@@ le &apos;s ted wish .
edi@@ th wid@@ der : oh my god . oh my god ! are you ki@@ dding me ? other scientists : oh h@@ o h@@ o ! that &apos;s just hanging there .
my age is three hundred and se@@ vent@@ y-@@ two i think with the deep@@ est regre@@ t how i used to pick up and vor@@ aci@@ ously che@@ w the de@@ ar little boys that i met i &apos;ve e@@ aten them raw in their holi@@ day su@@ its , e@@ aten them cur@@ ried with rice , i &apos;ve e@@ aten them bak@@ ed in their jac@@ ke@@ ts and bo@@ ots , and found them ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly nice . but now that my ja@@ ws are too weak for such fare , i think it &apos;s increasingly ru@@ de to do such a thing when i &apos;m quite well aware little boys do not like being che@@ wed . little boys do not like being che@@ wed . so now i cont@@ ent@@ ed@@ ly live upon e@@ els , and try to do nothing am@@ iss and pass all the time i can sp@@ are from my me@@ als in inno@@ cent sl@@ um@@ ber like this , inno@@ cent sl@@ um@@ ber like this . i suppose i o@@ we you an explanation .
she wrote this poem when she was 18 years old in 18@@ 8@@ 8 , and i look at it as kind of a very sweet femin@@ ist mani@@ fest@@ o tin@@ ged with a little bit of defi@@ ance and a little bit of res@@ ig@@ nation and regre@@ t .
i still have two minutes .
then we showed it in dolphins , and then later in eleph@@ ants .
this seems pre@@ histor@@ ic now , but this was where we were with technology .
p@@ g : so gro@@ om was the subject of the piece .
and so if we could also have this up , great .
jo@@ sh pl@@ ot@@ nik : hi , my name is jo@@ sh pl@@ ot@@ nik , and i &apos;m with think eleph@@ ants international , and we &apos;re here in the golden tri@@ angle of tha@@ iland with the golden tri@@ angle asi@@ an elephant foundation eleph@@ ants .
the internet of things tell us that a lot of computer-@@ en@@ abled appli@@ ances and devices are going to become part of this system too : appli@@ ances that you use around the house , that you use in your office , that you carry around with yourself or in the car .
the idea is this will be -- much like the internet functions as a network of networks , which is vin@@ t &apos;s core contribu@@ tion , this will be a wra@@ pper around all of these initi@@ a@@ tives , that are wonderful individu@@ ally , to link them globally .
and the cli@@ ent was saying , no , it &apos;s 10,000 a day .
but more seriously , i was like , okay , these ones work , but it &apos;s not just about me , it &apos;s about people from israel who want to say something .
and suddenly , there is something that was happening that was good news . so the guys on the news , they say , &quot; okay , let &apos;s talk about this . &quot;
they see images of us , and they see bad images .
just people sending their pictures .
so we basically cop@@ ied the form@@ at of the com@@ ic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scen@@ es , how our projects actually evolve through adap@@ tation and improvis@@ ation .
as you can see , sometimes a sub@@ species bran@@ ches off .
and he said , &quot; shanghai is the city in the world with most sky@@ scra@@ pers , &quot; but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over .
and it sort of shows the difference between these two cities .
when you go to the exhibition , you &apos;ll see the mer@@ ma@@ id and the pool .
and he said that he was going to do an apartment block next to a parking structure .
you can &apos;t just say that now i &apos;d like to do a sustainable city in central asia , because that &apos;s not really how you get com@@ mis@@ sions .
they accu@@ mu@@ late the solar energy .
there &apos;s two billions of people who will be sever@@ ely affected by climate change -- so on .
and also -- and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil -- to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
and so basically , this has been the cop@@ enhagen con@@ sen@@ sus &apos; process .
of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , i &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
and just to give you a sense of reference , the u.n. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
the second best thing would be to focus on mal@@ nutrition .
the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
i think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
but if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
&quot; give me liber@@ ty or give me death &quot; is all well and good if you can afford it , but if you &apos;re living on less than one dollar a day , you &apos;re far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to pro@@ claim and def@@ end democracy .
today , the united states and china are the two leading economies in the world .
the evidence around il@@ liberal democra@@ cies is quite depres@@ sing .
it &apos;s the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators .
so in a very typical , sil@@ ly designer fashion , after years worth of work , pretty much all i have to show for it are the ti@@ tles for the film .
as well as being married -- you are likely to be much happier than if you are single .
one of them is to think without pressure .
so as a fashion designer , i &apos;ve always ten@@ ded to think of materials something like this , or this , or maybe this .
it doesn &apos;t need light .
al@@ ig@@ n it in this direction .
hi . so i &apos;d like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day : our shoes , our hand@@ bags , our computers and cell phones .
other subjects came up almost never , including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life : 10 or 15 workers in one room , 50 people sharing a single ba@@ th@@ room , days and ni@@ ghts rul@@ ed by the factory clock .
about a year after i met l@@ u q@@ ing@@ min , or min , she invited me home to her family village for the chinese new year .
over the next two years , i watched as she swit@@ ched jobs five times , eventually land@@ ing a lu@@ cra@@ tive post in the pur@@ ch@@ asing department of a hardware factory .
when you talk to workers , that &apos;s what they want .
ha@@ z@@ rat ali is from a poor far@@ ming family in sw@@ at .
step four : the older members of the taliban , the figh@@ ters , start talking to the younger boys about the gl@@ ories of mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom .
i have laid down my life fighting the infi@@ d@@ els . &quot;
but in the mean@@ time i invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the satur@@ nine system , and visit the en@@ cel@@ a@@ dus inter@@ planet@@ ary ge@@ y@@ ser park , just because we can .
a squ@@ ir@@ rel had in fact che@@ wed on my internet .
and they &apos;re tiny . they &apos;re the thi@@ ck@@ ness of a hair .
then you can see the english engineers looking on .
and typically , you would take data , like the data of a pen here , which would be a ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric repres@@ entation of that product in 3d , and we would pass that data with material into a machine .
but what you &apos;ll notice about all of these products is they &apos;re very , very intri@@ cate .
and very hard to even create this by hand .
because , simply , most of us here today don &apos;t know how to create the data that a 3d prin@@ ter re@@ ads .
i &apos;m not sure about you guys , but i &apos;ve had experiences when i &apos;ve walked into a store and i &apos;ve know exactly what i &apos;ve wanted and i &apos;ve search@@ ed everywhere for that perfect lam@@ p that i know where i want to sit in my house and i just can &apos;t find the right thing , or that perfect piece of je@@ wel@@ ry as a gift or for myself .
while you wait at the den@@ ti@@ st , a machine will quie@@ tly be creating this for you ready to ins@@ ert in the teeth .
in that original idea , the concept of ji@@ had is as important to muslims as the idea of grace is to chri@@ sti@@ ans .
they had never paid him any attention before -- old man , small mosqu@@ e -- but now they began to pay vis@@ its , and sometimes they would dra@@ g him in for questions , and always the same question : &quot; why did you name your grand@@ daughter ji@@ had ?
but if you look closely , they &apos;re not fighting a global ji@@ had .
do we know , do we understand , who killed bin la@@ den@@ ism ?
we don &apos;t have to go back to that .
i was with my friend sus@@ an mei@@ sel@@ as , the photographer , in the ma@@ th@@ are valley slums .
she would go into the city at night with about 20 girls , look for work , and sometimes come back with a few sh@@ ill@@ ings , or sometimes with nothing .
and she said , &quot; what would i miss ?
it turns out , 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new hab@@ it or sub@@ tra@@ ct a hab@@ it -- like watching the news -- from your life .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with big , crazy challenges .
and i ear@@ ned enough money to pay for my first year of cal@@ tech .
and it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective .
so we tried to come up with a way of making a non-@@ tracking colle@@ ctor , a colle@@ ctor that would gather much more than one degree of light , with no moving parts .
but , his re@@ fin@@ ements were incredible .
but if your fuel source is free , then the only thing that matters is the up@@ -@@ front capital cost of the engine .
so you &apos;re re@@ using your energy five or six times , and that brings the efficiency up between 30 and 40 percent it &apos;s a little known , but brilliant , genius invention of robert stir@@ ling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat im@@ practical -- like i found out when i made the real simple version in high school -- to very potentially possible , once you get the efficiency up , if you can design this to be low enough cost .
each pe@@ tal ad@@ ju@@ sts itself separ@@ ately to keep the highest temperature on it .
this is how we would en@@ vision a res@@ identi@@ al application .
two other things that i learned that were very surprising to me -- one was how cas@@ ual we are about energy .
it &apos;s a big community . it &apos;s such a big community , in fact , that our an@@ nu@@ al gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world .
and this is the tower from below .
what i am always thinking about is what this session is about , which is called simplicity .
so , the pre@@ mis@@ e in the studio was , there are no boundaries , there is no fear .
this is andrew g@@ atz , and he walked in through the door and i said , &quot; you ! sit down there . &quot; you know , i take lots of photos .
they &apos;re not . &quot;
so , once a month for the last year , i &apos;ve been doing a colum@@ n called &quot; the principles of un@@ certainty , &quot; which , you know , i don &apos;t know who hei@@ sen@@ berg is , but i know i can throw that around now . you know , it &apos;s the principles of un@@ certainty , so , you know .
&quot; n@@ abo@@ ko@@ v &apos;s family fl@@ ed russia . how could the young n@@ abo@@ ko@@ v , sitting inno@@ cent@@ ly and elegan@@ tly in a red chair , le@@ af@@ ing through a book and bu@@ tter@@ flies , imagine such dis@@ plac@@ ement , such loss ? &quot;
what is it that we &apos;re actually -- what story are we actually telling ?
i do want to talk -- the absolute ic@@ ing on this ce@@ me@@ tery ca@@ ke is the barri@@ cin@@ i family m@@ aus@@ o@@ le@@ um near@@ by .
and when i was seven years old , all of a sudden , a search party arrived at my home .
i think that it &apos;s important for us to remember that we need to keep pushing forward on the en@@ dea@@ vor of the design of the heart .
and i think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us , but that , if we pay attention , we can see that there are little sym@@ b@@ ols of happiness in every breath that we take .
so if you look , you can see a lot of different machines come out of this . they all move around .
and we &apos;ve actually built a couple of these , and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cu@@ bes .
it &apos;s also carried on migration patterns of wild migr@@ atory a@@ qua@@ tic birds .
we had evolution over time , and this unbelie@@ vable mortality rate in human beings : 55 percent of people who have become infected with h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 have , in fact , suc@@ cum@@ bed .
if it were los angeles , is it the ma@@ yor , the gover@@ nor , the president of the united states , the head of hom@@ eland security ?
well then what about all the workers ? they won &apos;t go to work if their kids aren &apos;t in school .
a public health survey analy@@ zed the effect that lar@@ ge-@@ scale tam@@ i@@ flu use would have , actually shows it counter@@ active to public health meas@@ ures , making matters worse .
most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds -- ro@@ bu@@ stly healthy young adults .
and right now most of the prepar@@ e@@ dness is deeply fla@@ wed .
audience member : some research has indi@@ cated that stat@@ ins can be hel@@ p@@ ful .
and after cir@@ cul@@ ating around the world came back in a form that was tremend@@ ously leth@@ al .
lau@@ r@@ ie gar@@ re@@ tt : lessons from the 19@@ 18 flu
imagine an electric vehicle that can get you to work -- or anywhere in a six-@@ mile radi@@ us -- quickly , without traffic fru@@ stra@@ tions or gas@@ ol@@ ine . now imagine you can pick it up and carry it with you . yes , this sou@@ pe@@ d-@@ up sk@@ ate@@ board could change the face of morning com@@ mu@@ tes .
the cards were bigger than my hands .
the clu@@ bs were es@@ cap@@ ing me at each throw .
and a few days later , i was practic@@ ing on a single ti@@ gh@@ tro@@ pe .
it &apos;s a straight line , which sa@@ gs , which s@@ ways , which vi@@ br@@ ates , which roll@@ s on itself , which is ice , which is three tons ti@@ ght , ready to explo@@ de , ready to s@@ wal@@ low me .
and i chose to put my wire between the arab quarters and the jewish quarter of jerusalem over the ben hin@@ no@@ m valley .
they must think this guy with this do@@ ve , he must have spent years working with him .
i will never forget this music , and i hope now neither will you .
so we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us .
one of the challenges that can@@ opy researchers are attac@@ king today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequ@@ e@@ stered .
what i do is i bring together scientists and artists of all kinds , and we spend a week in the forest on these little plat@@ forms ; and we look at nature , we look at trees , we look at the can@@ opy , and we communicate , and exchange , and express what we see together .
if you remember that bald guy , you &apos;ll know that what has been stri@@ pped off of these tr@@ un@@ ks in the pacific nor@@ th@@ west ol@@ d-@@ growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back .
and so i &apos;m hoping that my husband jack , the ant tax@@ on@@ om@@ ist , can perhaps work with mat@@ tel to make tax@@ on@@ om@@ ist ken .
and they made mistakes , too , just like the children .
we &apos;re moving to what i would think of as a fully connected system , and we have global decisions to make in this system , decisions about climate , about finance systems , about resources . and think about it -- if we want to make an important decision about buying a house , we don &apos;t just go off . i mean , i don &apos;t know about you , but i want to see a lot of houses before i put that much money into it .
but again , when it comes to the decisions which are impac@@ ting us the most , perhaps , the most important decisions that are being made about war and so forth , it &apos;s really difficult . so we &apos;re still having to rely on il@@ legiti@@ mate ways of getting information , through lea@@ ks .
so that -- yes . yes ! my power pose .
this is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs i &apos;m going to show you today .
now , it &apos;s pretty obvious at this point that there &apos;s this zone here in the middle and that &apos;s the zone that really centers around my own personal pur@@ suit of happiness .
you die also because oxygen to@@ xic@@ ity can cause a sei@@ z@@ ure -- makes you con@@ vul@@ se underwater , not a good thing to happen underwater .
in 1994 , i was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype clo@@ se@@ d-@@ circuit re@@ brea@@ thers .
but , if we want to go deeper , of course , we need another gas supply .
it &apos;s really a very interesting -- you ever see &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; where ed harr@@ is , you know , he &apos;s sin@@ king down along the side of the wall ?

even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing , just look at the mon@@ et@@ ary value of this thing .
now , we &apos;ve done some back of the en@@ vel@@ ope calcu@@ lations , and we &apos;re predi@@ cting that there are probably on the order of 2,000 to 2,@@ 500 new species in the in@@ do@@ -@@ pacific alone .
because once you &apos;re dead , you really can &apos;t enjoy anything after that .
a program called brain electrical activity ma@@ pping then tri@@ ang@@ ul@@ ates the source of that ab@@ normal@@ ity in the brain .
so if i could inspire even a fra@@ ction of you in the audience today to share this pione@@ ering diagno@@ stic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a develop@@ mental disorder , then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved .
he built the capital over there .
and you know , when i knew him when i was in the office , he would come in from a trip , and he would be in the office for two or three days inten@@ sely , and he would pack up and go .
in 30 , 50 years back , it was nothing , only pa@@ d@@ dy fields , and since we invited him here , he felt that he has got a responsibility .
it &apos;s a story of nations , of ide@@ ologi@@ es , of terri@@ tories , and of conflicts among them .
our own technologies are visible over inter@@ stell@@ ar di@@ stances , and thei@@ rs might be as well .
it takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us .
we are one outcome of a continu@@ ing adap@@ tational process .
today , our signal dete@@ ction algorithms can find very simple arti@@ facts and noise .
and then , we &apos;d like to aug@@ ment the auto@@ mated search with human insight .
this past january , i traveled to a place called wa@@ is divide , about 600 miles from the south pole .
they cut the cy@@ lin@@ ders up into three-@@ foot se@@ ctions for easier hand@@ ling and shi@@ pment back to these labs , some 8@@ ,000 miles from the drill site .
they have to , in fact , make sure this ice never gets war@@ mer than about 20 degrees below zero , otherwise , the key g@@ ases inside it will dis@@ si@@ pa@@ te .
but the new story about oil is the government doesn &apos;t have to force us to do painful things to get off oil -- not just incre@@ mentally , but completely -- quite the contr@@ ary . the united states , for example , can completely elimin@@ ate its use of oil and re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ate the economy at the same time , led by business for profit , because it &apos;s so much cheaper to save and sub@@ stit@@ ute for the oil than to keep on buying it .
that seems to make more sense .
this muscle car from to@@ y@@ ota : 40@@ 8 hor@@ se@@ power in an ultra@@ -@@ light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds , and still gets 32 miles a gall@@ on . i &apos;ll say more later about this .
here &apos;s a hand@@ made mc@@ lar@@ en sl@@ r carbon car that got t-@@ bon@@ ed by a golf .
now , when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil , including buildings , industry , feed@@ sto@@ cks and so on , you find that of the 28 million bar@@ rel@@ s a day the government says we will need in 20@@ 25 , well , about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then , with another seven still being saved as the vehicle sto@@ cks turn over , at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel , instead of 26 for buying the oil .
so this is a huge social win , too .
we could r@@ er@@ un that play a lot better now .
we spent two and a half years conduc@@ ting research ; we spent another year and a half in adv@@ ance development .
one kind of re@@ vie@@ wer is a male gam@@ er who thinks he knows what games ought to be , and won &apos;t show the product to little girls .

we can , for example , go find mi@@ ko &apos;s lo@@ cker and get some more information about her .
and what he really wanted was something by ver@@ meer .

so take food .
these are stimul@@ i i &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
so one reason why you might like something is its utili@@ ty .
so let &apos;s go back to art .
i &apos;ve been focusing now on the visual arts , but i want to give two examples from music .
so it was a series of five painful sho@@ cks .
it has this bizarre , on@@ going philosop@@ hi@@ cal project of divi@@ ding all the in@@ anima@@ te objects in the world into the ones that either cause or prevent cancer .
again , every country has somebody like this .
&quot; an austr@@ ali@@ an study in 2001 found that o@@ live oil in combination with fru@@ its , vege@@ tables and pul@@ ses offers meas@@ ur@@ able protection against skin wr@@ in@@ kl@@ ings . &quot;
now can anybody spot a fla@@ w in this design ?
but actually in a lot of situations that &apos;s wrong .
and this is the most important aspect of the whole story .
i hope i try to go out of my way to try and read and understand all the literature .
but i would say this : i think that sunlight is the best dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ant .
and i realized , because the chinese ing@@ rati@@ ated themselves with a small rul@@ ing class here in the united states who sto@@ le all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves .
that &apos;s the warm up .
because they have an entire economic system that &apos;s dependent on that oil -- foreign oil , oil from other parts of the world that they don &apos;t own .
and what you see , something else , the united states , the hu@@ b of democracy around the world , they don &apos;t seem to really be suppor@@ ting democratic countries all around the world .
and you feel something about that -- of course you do .
and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; my god , these chri@@ sti@@ ans are coming to kill us . &quot;
and of course , chri@@ sti@@ ans back in the united states , or anybody , says , &quot; ah , this is some little , tiny church in the middle of nowhere . &quot;
but some of you do .
what are you feeling and thinking about this photo , about this woman ?
you see , that &apos;s empathy .
thank you .
year after year after year , absolutely incredible .
but what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before .
well how else can we create new ideas ?
we will see an einstein in africa in this century .
in kur@@ zwei@@ li@@ an terms this is glo@@ om@@ y .
the world is much better equi@@ pped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today , than ever in the past , because of what i &apos;m talking about .
as far back as i can remember , i was en@@ chan@@ ted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tro@@ pic@@ al ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ance of the plants and animals that grow there .
the fact is , we don &apos;t know .
but each of these species , even the tin@@ i@@ est pro@@ ch@@ lor@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ i , are master@@ pieces of evolution .
that &apos;s in the united states .
the en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications .
there was a bird that people liked on the east coast called the he@@ ath hen .
then the question is , can you reas@@ se@@ m@@ ble , with that genome , the whole bird ?
another direct result was a young grad student named ben no@@ va@@ k , who had been obsessed with passen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ ons since he was 14 and had also learned how to work with ancient dna , himself sequen@@ ced the passen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on , using money from his family and friends .
at the san die@@ go zo@@ o , his frozen zo@@ o has collected the tissu@@ es from over 1,000 species over the last 35 years .
so basically , they &apos;re learning how to build on good news .
what are they concerned about ?
stewart brand : the da@@ wn of de-@@ extin@@ ction . are you ready ?
a published author of books came to talk to us about what he did for a living .
and my grandfather , he was a wise man , and he saw that as a problem , because he knew that was , like , the one thing i had . i didn &apos;t play sports .
&quot; you &apos;re really good . you know , the school newspaper needs a new carto@@ on@@ ist , and you should be the carto@@ on@@ ist .
and i didn &apos;t understand . he said , &quot; you have a great style .
now , i used to work the wee@@ ken@@ ds at the hole in the wall off@@ -@@ season progra@@ mming to make some extra money as i was trying to get my feet off the ground , and this kid who was just this really hy@@ per kid , i started calling him &quot; monkey boy , &quot; and i went home and wrote a book called &quot; good night , monkey boy . &quot;
i have 10 picture books out .
architects and designers tend to focus exclu@@ si@@ vely on these .
this is an area i in@@ tend to take on this year .
if education can be li@@ ken@@ ed to wat@@ ering a garden , which is a fair metaphor , sa@@ dly , much of the water is ev@@ a@@ por@@ ating before it reach@@ es the flowers , especially for some groups , for example , those with hearing im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment .
let &apos;s bro@@ aden the perspective a little bit and look at cities .
i love the idea that you can transform , become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective .
all right . let &apos;s start with theater .
and that usually , if you &apos;re a bit extraordinary , if you &apos;re not exactly of human appe@@ ar@@ ance , then people will feel in@@ clin@@ ed to participate and to feel out loud .
charlie chap@@ lin innov@@ ated motion pictures and told stories through music , silence , humor and poetry .
but i also met al@@ umin@@ um m@@ old makers , amm@@ uni@@ tion produ@@ cers and all kinds of people .
but i didn &apos;t want you to miss out on this one , because this , well , it &apos;s called &quot; por@@ tion-@@ controlled meat cu@@ ts . &quot;
and once it &apos;s in the right spot , they remove the ou@@ ter shell , and the heart val@@ ve , well , it gets this shape and at that moment it starts be@@ ating , inst@@ antly .
james com@@ er says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship .
you were so excited , we just let you go . &quot;
i said , &quot; because you &apos;re on a roll .
how powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks , who were not afraid to think , and who had a cham@@ pi@@ on ?
the problem is , which ver@@ bs go in which con@@ struc@@ tions ?
now , many events can be subject to either constru@@ al , kind of like the classic figu@@ re-@@ ground rever@@ sal illu@@ sions , in which you can either pay attention to the particular object , in which case the space around it re@@ ce@@ des from attention , or you can see the faces in the empty space , in which case the object re@@ ce@@ des out of consciousness .
as when we say we &quot; gather &quot; our ideas , to &quot; put &quot; them &quot; into &quot; words , and if our words aren &apos;t &quot; empty &quot; or &quot; hol@@ low , &quot; we might get these ideas &quot; across &quot; to a listen@@ er , who can &quot; un@@ pack &quot; our words to &quot; extract &quot; their &quot; content . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why are bri@@ bes , poli@@ te re@@ que@@ sts , soli@@ cit@@ ations and thre@@ ats so often vei@@ led ?
on the other hand , you want the dam@@ n gu@@ ac@@ amo@@ le .
my name is dan co@@ hen , and i am academic , as he said .
so why do we even try to argue ?
it is the dominant way of thinking about arguments .
and i have a question : &quot; well , what do you mean ?
but i have some sugge@@ sti@@ ons , and here &apos;s my sugge@@ stion .
they pa@@ dd@@ le faster , and faster , and faster , until they &apos;re going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water , and they &apos;re standing up@@ right , sort of pa@@ dd@@ ling the top of the water .
and i said , that &apos;s what this is ; this is cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate .
it &apos;s not sla@@ vis@@ h@@ ly mi@@ mi@@ cking -- although al is trying to get the ha@@ ir@@ do going -- it &apos;s not a sla@@ vis@@ h mi@@ mi@@ cry ; it &apos;s taking the design principles , the genius of the natural world , and learning something from it .
because life doesn &apos;t really deal in things ; there are no things in the natural world di@@ vor@@ ced from their systems .
on the left , this is a bri@@ ttle star ; it &apos;s covered with len@@ ses that the people at lu@@ cent technologies have found have no di@@ stor@@ tion what@@ so@@ ever .
there &apos;s a company making a product called lot@@ us@@ an , which mi@@ mi@@ cs -- when the building fac@@ ade paint dri@@ es , it mi@@ mi@@ cs the bu@@ mp@@ s in a self-@@ clean@@ ing lea@@ f , and rain@@ water cle@@ ans the building .
and he found a way to dry out vaccin@@ es -- en@@ case them in the same sort of sugar cap@@ su@@ les as the tar@@ di@@ grade has within its cells -- meaning that vaccin@@ es no longer need to be re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ated .
because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life .
none of the women i had grown up with in mar@@ y@@ land had gradu@@ ated from college , let alone considered business school .
so maybe you could interview her . &quot;
they are often ignor@@ ed because they &apos;re harder to help .
we have so much room to grow .
we are the majority .
for this de@@ light and for this wonder , people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
for example : is this evil ?
and so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and i &apos;m going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we &apos;re doing on the bottom .
now , if i hadn &apos;t paid attention to em@@ bo@@ died energy , it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the up@@ gra@@ ded house .
so i did .
so this is be@@ tty . she &apos;s a new cal@@ e@@ don@@ ian cro@@ w .
and were enter@@ ta@@ ined to discover that for the rest of the week , these cro@@ ws , whenever these particular students walked around campus , these cro@@ ws would ca@@ w at them , and run around and make their life kind of miser@@ able .
and as we heard yesterday , that &apos;s the p@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box that &apos;s getting human beings in trouble , and we &apos;re starting to see it with them .
the cro@@ ws learn that all they have to do is show up , wait for the co@@ in to come out , put the co@@ in in the s@@ lot , and then they get their pe@@ an@@ ut .
hacker and writer joshua klein is fascinated by cro@@ ws . after a long amate@@ ur study of cor@@ vid behavior , he &apos;s come up with an elegant thought experiment : a machine that could form a new bond between animal and human .
and this guy comes up to me , and he &apos;s got tat@@ to@@ os and his pon@@ y@@ tail and his baseball cap on , and he had his two daughters with him , and he said , &quot; go@@ v , these are my two daughters . &quot;
well , they &apos;re going to places that have policy , like china .
so you could wait and go through congress , although you should be very im@@ patient .
in our media environment , it &apos;s as if they don &apos;t even exist .
they ag@@ gre@@ gate around the things they love , the things that they like , and if you think about it , shared interests and values are a far more powerful ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ator of human beings than demo@@ graphic categ@@ ories .
and so , if you have any interest in understanding the world , looking at how people am@@ use themselves is a really good way to start .
i &apos;ll get a lon@@ ely , little sentence with real error in it , &quot; yeah , i guess i could come inside , but only for a minute . &quot;
everybody gets heard .
people with spinal cor@@ d inju@@ ries , like par@@ ap@@ legi@@ as , quad@@ ri@@ ple@@ gi@@ as , will often develop a very , very sensitive area right above the level of their in@@ jury , wherever that is .
and if you trig@@ ger , if you stimu@@ late with an electro@@ de , the precise spot , you will trig@@ ger an or@@ gas@@ m .
very heavy he@@ ter@@ o guy .
and they decided , being ma@@ sters and johnson , that they would get to the bottom of it .
and they had the farmers -- there is po@@ sters they put in the bar@@ n , and they have a dv@@ d .
so possibly , you know , a little more ar@@ ous@@ ing than it looks .
he got together in his lab 300 men , a measuring tape , and a movie camera .
this truly is an at@@ -@@ risk population with very few resources to support them .
this is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes .
i &apos;m from a completely different cultural area , maybe you noticed ?
yeah . the artist doesn &apos;t really seem to know where to put the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that you &apos;re still a little bit skep@@ tical .
it &apos;s called &quot; un@@ ti@@ t@@ led &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
so after a while i decided to have a little fun , and before leaving the room each day i &apos;d sc@@ at@@ ter a few things around the space .
and now they &apos;re all in here .
my dad was , which is kind of an interesting way to grow up .
all of us ? designers ?
and i said , &quot; oh , girls , dad is a very important journalist , that just wouldn &apos;t do at all . &quot;
someone making the experience their own .
in fact , the whole technology of sper@@ m extra@@ ction for spinal cor@@ d-@@ inju@@ red males was invented by a veter@@ in@@ arian .
hey , the name a@@ ja@@ x -- you can &apos;t get much more inten@@ tional than that , right ?
today it is the chaos of humanity &apos;s impact on the earth itself that we con@@ front .
and i looked at his wh@@ ack@@ y pe@@ dal mechanism ; he was full of pri@@ de over his design .
&quot; nurse ! is this the 2@@ 8@@ th or the 2@@ 9@@ th ? &quot;
from my seat , i was looking up at a stone town on a h@@ ill@@ top , bright in the no@@ on@@ time sun , when from behind there was a great bang , as loud and violent as a bomb .
i pit@@ ched over@@ hand in a wee@@ k@@ ly soft@@ ball game that i started in central park , and home in new york , i became a journalist and an author , typ@@ ing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger .
i would be less mind@@ ful of time and of death , and , oh , i would not be dis@@ abled , would not suffer the thousand sl@@ ings and arro@@ ws of my fortune .
it was then that abed res@@ um@@ ed at once the tale of wo@@ e he had be@@ gun over the phone 16 years before .
it was then that god interven@@ ed : news on the tv of a car w@@ re@@ ck that hours before had killed three people up north .
he was not a particularly bad man or a particularly good man .
i told him the name of that man .
okay . so i &apos;m s@@ mil@@ ing .
and it was kind of spo@@ o@@ ky , because he would say these things that just so@@ unded like they really understood you .
whether it &apos;s nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works .
isn &apos;t there something shor@@ ter ?
because if you do the math , you have a thousand tedtalks , the pay 10 cents each ; you have to do more than one sum@@ mary for each of those talks , because some of them will probably be , or are , really bad .
i had started out with a thousand tedtalks and i had 600 six-@@ word sum@@ mar@@ ies for those .
seba@@ stian wer@@ ni@@ cke thinks every tedtalk can be sum@@ mar@@ ized in six words . in this talk , he shows how to do just that -- and less . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
that &apos;s like to@@ s@@ sing an apple up@@ ward and it goes up faster and faster .
first off , what is it ?
the list of candi@@ date shapes has so@@ ared to about 10 to the 500 .
an early example comes from the great astronom@@ er jo@@ han@@ nes ke@@ pl@@ er who was obsessed with understanding a different number -- why the sun is 9@@ 3 million miles away from the earth .
instead the fuel not only generated our big bang , but it would also generate coun@@ t@@ less other big ban@@ gs , each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cos@@ mic bubble bat@@ h of univer@@ ses .
i suspe@@ ct the lat@@ ter .
when i saw a piece of technology called kin@@ e@@ ct -- it was called nat@@ al -- i was inspired , and i thought for a moment , maybe it &apos;s possible to address that one problem of story@@ telling , to create a character which seemed alive , which noticed me , that could look me in the eyes and feel real , and sc@@ ul@@ pt a story about our relationship .
the cool thing is , what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re changing the mind of milo constantly .
peter m@@ oly@@ neu@@ x : what are you going to do , di@@ mit@@ ri ?
you stand up , and you sk@@ im the stone .
it &apos;s all been too much for him .
that means milo &apos;s mind , as millions of people use it , will get smar@@ ter and cle@@ ver@@ er .
the sie@@ ge went on for three and a half years , and it was a sie@@ ge without water , without power , without electricity , without heat , without food , in the middle of europe , in the middle of the 20th century .
in 1994 , i briefly left sar@@ a@@ je@@ vo to go report the geno@@ cide in rwanda .
but there will always be another war . &quot;
i always tell the students that we could also call neuro@@ scientists some sort of astronom@@ er , because we are dealing with a system that is only compar@@ able in terms of number of cells to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe .
well , while au@@ r@@ ora was playing this game , as you saw , and doing a thousand trials a day and getting 97 percent correct and 350 milli@@ li@@ ters of orange ju@@ ice , we are recording the brain@@ stor@@ ms that are produced in her head and sending them to a robotic arm that was learning to re@@ produce the movements that au@@ r@@ ora was making .
and the feedback that comes from the a@@ vat@@ ar is being process@@ ed directly by the brain without the inter@@ ference of the skin .
what happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmit@@ ted to japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to du@@ ke , so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her .
look , you all are very well traveled ; this is tedglobal after all .
he thought , &quot; oh , i can ren@@ o@@ v@@ ate the school .
how many of you think there are more males or more fe@@ males in the world ?
it &apos;s kind of like the dirty , little secret of poverty , which is that , not only do poor people take in very little income , but also , the income that they take in , they don &apos;t spend it very wi@@ sely , and unfortunately , most of that spending is done by men .
but you know , there is progress being made in places like cam@@ bo@@ dia and tha@@ iland .
because she had some damage to her ner@@ ves , she cra@@ w@@ led all the way -- 30 miles -- to that do@@ or@@ step , half dead .
and then , when she had to transport all of the em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y goods from the village to the market@@ place , she needed someone to help her do the transport , so she hi@@ red her husband .
on the day of her gradu@@ ation , she said , &quot; i am the lu@@ ck@@ i@@ est girl alive because of a go@@ at . &quot;
and that is the story of an aid worker in dar@@ fur .
and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first disco@@ vers that , mer@@ ely by u@@ tter@@ ing a sound , it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic , and maybe even into its mouth .
because this is exactly what our ancestors , the homo er@@ ec@@ tus , did .
because our ac@@ quisi@@ tion of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma , the resolution of which , it &apos;s fair to say , would determine not only the future course of our psychology , but the future course of the entire world .
and to see why , consider two scen@@ ari@@ os from early in our evolution .
language really is the most po@@ tent tra@@ it that has ever evolved .
in fact , it &apos;s a map of facebook friend@@ ship links .
and it &apos;s the dilemma that this chinese man faces , who &apos;s language is spoken by more people in the world than any other single language , and yet he is sitting at his black@@ board , conver@@ ting chinese phr@@ ases into english language phr@@ ases .
over a five year period following september 1@@ 1@@ th , when the american media and government were see@@ king hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders , most not@@ ably weapons of mass destruction , i chose to look in@@ ward at that which was integra@@ l to america &apos;s foundation , myth@@ ology and daily func@@ tioning .
this is a jury simulation deli@@ ber@@ ation room , and you can see beyond that two-@@ way mirror jury ad@@ vis@@ ers standing in a room behind the mirror .
and play@@ boy is always in the top few .
it &apos;s called the world church of god .
fre@@ deri@@ ck da@@ ye , who is photographed at his ali@@ bi location , where 13 wit@@ n@@ esses placed him at the time of the crime .
william gre@@ g@@ ory was con@@ vi@@ cted of ra@@ pe and bur@@ gl@@ ary .
so i started sket@@ ching .
but g@@ .@@ s. industries was fantastic .
google earth goes from this view down to your back@@ yard .
and just being able to visit different places and go through different times , we have data from 1950 to 2050 .
i &apos;m going to go back to today , now , and i want to show you where voy@@ ager 1 is .
these rou@@ tes to happiness haven &apos;t really increased happiness very much .
cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l f@@ loo@@ ds the brain ; it destro@@ ys hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pal cells and memory , and can lead to all kinds of health problems .
ab@@ sent from this list , and ab@@ sent from any discus@@ sions of happiness , are happiness in another &apos;s happiness .
dopam@@ ine system , the wanting system , is much more cent@@ r@@ alized .
and being alone is very un@@ natural to the human .
so clearly there is some effect .
cognitive researcher nan@@ cy et@@ co@@ ff looks at happiness -- the ways we try to achieve and increase it , the way it &apos;s un@@ te@@ ther@@ ed to our real circumstances , and its surprising effect on our bodies .
and the animal comes back for a food reward .
if the animal does that , it gets a license as an ac@@ cre@@ di@@ ted animal to be oper@@ ational in the field -- just like dogs , by the way .
we &apos;re talking now explo@@ si@@ ves , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ los@@ is , but can you imagine , you can actually put anything under there .
also , to standar@@ di@@ ze the pel@@ lets , the food re@@ wards , and to se@@ mi@@ -@@ auto@@ mate this in order to repli@@ cate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .
one approach is to look at patients who had les@@ i@@ ons in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior .
now , let &apos;s look at culture , the phenomenon of human culture .
well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got re@@ cep@@ tors in your skin , touch and pain re@@ cep@@ tors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re not being touched .
neuro@@ scientist vil@@ ay@@ an@@ ur ra@@ mach@@ and@@ ran out@@ lines the fascinating functions of mirror neurons . only recently discovered , these neurons allow us to learn complex social behaviors , some of which formed the foun@@ da@@ tions of human civilization as we know it .
if you actually didn &apos;t realize that plants have sex , they have ra@@ mp@@ ant , promis@@ cu@@ ous and really quite interesting and curious sex . really .
okay , so this is another species evolved to be dis@@ per@@ sed by insects .
this is a horse ch@@ est@@ nu@@ t .
heart disease kill@@ s more women at all ages than breast cancer .
she had to im@@ person@@ ate a man .
well there was a little piece of that women &apos;s health initiative that went to national heart , lung , and blood institute , which is the car@@ di@@ ology part of the ni@@ h .
right here , it &apos;s just a fo@@ cal -- right there .
and we &apos;re about two and a half years into a five-@@ year study .
that &apos;s all stem cells .
but we cannot stop now .
we plate them into dis@@ hes that we sometimes call pe@@ tr@@ i dis@@ hes .
let &apos;s see how powerful just one of these essen@@ ti@@ als can be .
tissue engineer and fellow n@@ ina t@@ and@@ on is growing artificial hearts and bones . to do that , she needs new ways of car@@ ing for arti@@ fi@@ cially grown cells -- techniques she &apos;s developed by the simple but powerful method of cop@@ ying their natural environments .
so you &apos;ve all , i &apos;m sure , seen ti@@ me-@@ lap@@ se videos where a flower will blo@@ s@@ so@@ m as you acceler@@ ate time .
of course , my son is learning from his lingu@@ i@@ stic environment , but the environment is learning from him .
and there &apos;s our nan@@ ny by the door .
and you don &apos;t have to now go and instrument living rooms with micro@@ phones to get people &apos;s conversations , you just tun@@ e into publi@@ c@@ ly available social media fe@@ eds .
that drives tun@@ e-@@ in behavior back into mass media , and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior .
and i really want you to focus on something as i take you through .
and this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning , the better we can communicate , and , i also think , the better we can think and collabor@@ ate together .
it &apos;s the kind of gut center , where you see an image and you go , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever i &apos;m seeing . &quot;
what we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strate@@ gic plan on one giant wall .
this is the first house i built .
after all , it &apos;s not just a question of hy@@ gi@@ ene , but there &apos;s a possibility of re@@ creation as well .
so don &apos;t put it there .
so you translate that to the building industry , if we have a wall of win@@ dow@@ pan@@ es and one pan@@ e is cra@@ cked , we go , &quot; oh , de@@ ar . that &apos;s cra@@ cked . let &apos;s repair it .
that &apos;s the difference .
&quot; dan , i just don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready . &quot;
it out@@ -@@ gas@@ ses for@@ mal@@ de@@ hy@@ de so much so that there is a federal law in place to war@@ n new mobile home bu@@ yers of the for@@ mal@@ de@@ hy@@ de atmosphere danger .
it &apos;s a pretty quick read .
those kids , they &apos;ll work all summer long , kill themselves , so that they can afford one pair of designer je@@ ans .
early on , contra@@ ctors come by and say , &quot; dan , you &apos;re a cute little bun@@ ny , but you know , this just isn &apos;t going to work .
this is a police photo . that &apos;s actually my car .
it &apos;s a cu@@ pu@@ le that took 40 to 50,000 blo@@ ws with a stone tool to create , and it &apos;s the first known expression of art on the planet .
i discovered during my recovery the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide .
neuro@@ logical damage , 10 years of re@@ hab , requires a long-term perspective .
and then i cre@@ ep up to the point that i get a score of 7@@ 9 , which is just below average .
two elements that worked for me here are -- the first is 90 percent , i learned , of head and ne@@ ck pain is through mus@@ cul@@ ar-@@ skelet@@ al im@@ balance .
using this technology , the speci@@ alists at u@@ cl@@ a medical center were able to identify where that com@@ pres@@ sion in the ho@@ se pi@@ pe was oc@@ curr@@ ing .
a radio device is controlling every step i take , and a sensor pi@@ cks up my foot for me every time i walk .
so i think this one detail went past people really quick .
because what i didn &apos;t say in my talk is this is actually ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ al .
i did also an un@@ ethical study of the profess@@ ors of the kar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a institute -- that hands out the nobel prize in medicine , and they are on p@@ ar with the chimpanze@@ e there .
the africans are the green down here . they still remain here .
and the best proje@@ ction from the world bank is that this will happen , and we will not have a divided world . we &apos;ll have most people in the middle .
and we have seen how countries move in different directions like this , so it &apos;s sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world .
it &apos;s not the new datab@@ ase you need . we have wonderful design tools , and more and more are added up here . so we started a non@@ profit venture which we called -- lin@@ king data to design -- we call it gap@@ min@@ der , from the london underground , where they war@@ n you , &quot; mind the gap . &quot; so we thought gap@@ min@@ der was appropriate .
it &apos;s pretty scary . but i think it &apos;s very important to have all this information .
and by the age of 11 , i was no longer going to sun@@ day mass , and going on bir@@ d@@ watching walks with my father .
and this was mau@@ rice wil@@ kins . he was trained as a physicist , and after the war he wanted to do bi@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ cs , and he picked dna because dna had been determined at the rock@@ ef@@ eller institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosom@@ es .
and so we didn &apos;t build any models , and franc@@ is sort of continued to work on proteins .
but wil@@ kins said &quot; no . &quot; ro@@ sal@@ ind frank@@ lin was leaving in about two months , and after she left he would start building models .
most scientists are really rather dul@@ l .
well , at that time -- i should go back .
looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars . and the parent of a child with as@@ per@@ ger &apos;s disease , the high-@@ intelligence autism , had sent his thing to a conventional company ; they didn &apos;t do it .
and if i had enough money , we &apos;d find them all this year .
now perhaps it &apos;s because no such scre@@ en@@ shots actually existed , but suddenly goo@@ se@@ berry wanted to se@@ ttle .
now this is a tac@@ tic that patent tro@@ ll@@ s are supposed to use on people to get their way .
&quot; i haven &apos;t heard from my dad in years . &quot;
at this moment , i saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasi@@ on and to become their own heroes .
this was going to be used as a tou@@ ch@@ stone so when they started to miss each other and feel dis@@ connected , they could re@@ connect through this image .
people were terri@@ fied of this disease .
and this is the reason : in two countries that hadn &apos;t had this disease for more than probably a decade , on opposite sides of the globe , there was suddenly terrible polio out@@ breaks .
so we are trying to wi@@ pe out this virus completely .
there &apos;s over 10 million people , probably 20 million people , largely volunteers , who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internation@@ all@@ y-@@ coordin@@ ated operation in peac@@ e@@ time .
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradi@@ cation program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , ir@@ respe@@ ctive of geograph@@ y , poverty , culture and even conflict .
but you know i &apos;d love to be able to tell you that u@@ mar is a typical kid with polio these days , but it &apos;s not true .
so this morning at about seven o &apos;@@ clock , i decided that we &apos;d try to drive chris and the production cre@@ w here ber@@ ser@@ k by down@@ lo@@ ading all of our data from india again , so that you could see something that &apos;s just un@@ folding today , which pro@@ ves that the impossible is possible .
but if we blin@@ k now , we will lose forever the chance to eradi@@ cate an ancient disease .
we have a big gap in that money . we &apos;re cutting cor@@ ners , and every time we cut cor@@ ners , more places get infected that shouldn &apos;t have , and it just slo@@ ws us down .
and of course , we were stun@@ ned for a while , but when we managed to get our wi@@ ts about us , we looked at it and said , &quot; my go@@ sh , what &apos;s going to happen with that little cu@@ b ?
we dro@@ w@@ ned our pri@@ de , i must tell you , which was really serious , and we sei@@ zed the engine .
d@@ j : the amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a high@@ light of our career -- is that you never know how it &apos;s going to end .
b@@ j : and on this first h@@ unt , we truly were excited .
b@@ j : and then che@@ e@@ ta@@ hs have crash@@ ed all the way down to 12@@ ,000 .
so this is not just a concern about li@@ ons ; it &apos;s a concern about communities in africa as well .
it post@@ ul@@ ates a vast and rapidly growing number of univer@@ ses existing in parallel -- mu@@ tu@@ ally un@@ dete@@ ctable except through the nar@@ row por@@ tho@@ le of quantum mechanical experiments .
we are evolved den@@ i@@ zens of middle world , and that limits what we are capable of imag@@ ining . we find it intui@@ tively easy to gras@@ p ideas like , when a rab@@ bit moves at the sort of medium vel@@ o@@ city at which rab@@ bits and other middle world objects move , and hits another middle world object , like a rock , it kno@@ cks itself out .
it &apos;s what &apos;s techni@@ cally known as a &quot; bar@@ ch@@ an , &quot; and the entire dun@@ e walks across the desert in a we@@ ster@@ ly direction at a speed of about 17 meters per year .
the fact that the bat uses e@@ cho@@ es in pit@@ ch darkness to input the current vari@@ ables to its model , while the s@@ wal@@ low uses light , is inci@@ dent@@ al .
we don &apos;t know how many planets there are in the universe , but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20 , or 100 billion billion .
the econom@@ ically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a pur@@ pos@@ eful , go@@ al-@@ see@@ king agent with pleas@@ ures and pa@@ ins , des@@ ires and inten@@ tions , guil@@ t , bl@@ am@@ e-@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
over@@ night , i became a mu@@ te quad@@ ri@@ ple@@ gic at the ri@@ pe old age of 40 .
using a mouse cur@@ sor i control with my head , these web inter@@ faces allow me to see video from the robot and send control comm@@ ands by pres@@ sing butt@@ ons in a web brow@@ ser .
i would have died .
it &apos;s like a looking glass into a hidden world .
and if we kind of pon@@ der on that , then perhaps cy@@ ma@@ tics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself .
that said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
and what i understand from my brazi@@ li@@ an friends is that this guy is just a c@@ liche machine .
and you tend to find top@@ ics that are almost entirely afri@@ can@@ -@@ american conversations .
it &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to fi@@ j@@ ian music .
so here &apos;s the problem that i &apos;ve been interested in in the last decade or so .
it &apos;s one of these rare cases where the u.s. is actually slightly better than &#91; the u.k. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice ver@@ sa .
they were doing something much simpl@@ er .
who &apos;s going after chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
i can ask her what to read .
and every week on this television show , d@@ han@@ i tra@@ vels to a different nation of the world .
so the teacher r@@ ings up the parents , and says , &quot; very sho@@ cking story from little bil@@ ly today .
i remember in iraq , for example , that we went through a period of feeling that we should del@@ ay democracy .
if you ask about child tax cre@@ di@@ ts , the future of the penguins in the south ant@@ arctic , asked to hold forth on whether or not the develop@@ ments in ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing contribute to sustainable development in carbon capture , and we will have an answer for you .
so , let me present the question to you : if our ben@@ ch@@ mark for americ@@ an@@ ness is apple p@@ ie , you should ask yourself , how often do you eat apple p@@ ie , versus how often do you eat chinese food . right ?
well , the short answer is , we locked up all the japanese during world war ii , including those that made fortune coo@@ k@@ ies , so that &apos;s the time when the chinese moved in , kind of saw a market opportunity and took over .
because it doesn &apos;t look like chinese food to them .
this is actually in the library of congress ; it is a p@@ am@@ ph@@ let published by sam@@ u@@ el g@@ om@@ pers , hero of our american labor movement , and it &apos;s called , &quot; some reason for chinese exclu@@ sion : meat versus rice : american man@@ hood against asi@@ a@@ tic coo@@ li@@ eis@@ m : which shall survive ?
this is a dish called magic bow@@ l that i discovered .
but it was true , and basically , of those 1@@ 10 people , and 10@@ 4 of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune coo@@ k@@ ie .
so , the thing is , our historical l@@ ore , because of the way we like narra@@ tives , are full of vast characters such as , you know , howard schul@@ tz of star@@ bucks and ray kro@@ c with mcdonald &apos;s and as@@ a ch@@ and@@ ler with coca@@ -@@ cola .
so they got very interested in producing con@@ vul@@ sions , measured types of con@@ vul@@ sions .
and then in the 195@@ 0s , late 195@@ 0s , the so-called muscle rela@@ x@@ ants were developed by pharma@@ colo@@ gi@@ sts , and it got so that you could indu@@ ce a complete con@@ vul@@ sion , an electro@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ ogra@@ phic con@@ vul@@ sion -- you could see it on the brain waves -- without causing any con@@ vul@@ sion in the body except a little bit of twi@@ t@@ ching of the toes .
as my refer@@ r@@ als began to decre@@ ase , i clearly became increasingly depressed until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
and there were particular numbers that every time i saw them , just got me dre@@ ad@@ fully up@@ set -- all kinds of ritu@@ ali@@ stic obser@@ van@@ ces , just awful , awful stuff .
and he went back to them , and they agreed to do another 10 .
well , you know , it &apos;s been a wonderful life .
and for those who are older , who have lived through perhaps not something as bad as this , but who have lived through difficult times , perhaps where they lost everything , as i did , and started out all over again , some of these things will seem very familiar .
when you actually look at the motor of the world economy , it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries .
so , you &apos;re on vac@@ ation at a nice beach , and word comes through that there &apos;s been a massive earthquake and that there is a tsunami advan@@ cing on the beach .
you &apos;re building on people &apos;s ideas and values -- that perhaps they &apos;re cand@@ les that burn very di@@ m@@ ly on certain occasi@@ ons .
the idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at human@@ itarian risk is now being establi@@ shed as a principle which gover@@ ns the world .
i certainly have been putting forward pro@@ pos@@ als that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world to feel that we have taken into account their specific needs .
thank you .
and so we get this starting material .
and you can think of different forma@@ ts .
silk , during its self-@@ assembly process , acts like a co@@ co@@ on for biological matter .
the bot , our rising cele@@ bri@@ ty , also has his own twitter account : @ robot@@ in@@ the@@ wild .
it &apos;s an honor to be here .
first , let &apos;s make sure he &apos;s dead . &quot;
it &apos;s a nor@@ m . it &apos;s a social nor@@ m .
we can reach them . there are pa@@ ths that enable us to reach them .
how might we think differently about our relations with people ?
anyway , he was a photographer and a street educ@@ ator , and he always taught us to o@@ be@@ y the law very stri@@ ctly .
these are mine , i was born an ar@@ gent@@ ine@@ an .
his family was jewish , so they were ho@@ unded .
anyway , he had to do all this because he was completely obsessed with output .
time passed , and they thought he had surely for@@ gotten them , at first .
all my childhood , while my friends &apos; da@@ ds would tell them gri@@ mm &apos;s fair@@ y tal@@ es , my father would tell me stories about very un@@ assum@@ ing heroes with uns@@ ha@@ ke@@ able u@@ top@@ i@@ as who managed to make mira@@ cles .
it &apos;s a very important period -- it &apos;s roughly half the period when we &apos;ve been fully modern humans on the planet .
simul@@ taneously , they bran@@ ch off in the mid-@@ 5@@ 0s , 10 years after the second world war , showing very clearly that the great acceler@@ ation of the human enter@@ prise starts in the mid-@@ 5@@ 0s .
and this is the new paradigm , which we gather@@ ed two , three years back , recogni@@ zing that our old paradigm of just analy@@ zing and pushing and predi@@ cting param@@ e@@ ters into the future , a@@ im@@ ing at minim@@ alizing environmental impac@@ ts , is of the past .
now the question then is : how glo@@ om@@ y is this ?
we need nothing less than a new green revolution , and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse g@@ ases to a sin@@ k .
thank you .
it was very -- actually , it was a very good study , and got me a job in an ad agency .
this is the ash@@ ant@@ i jo@@ y@@ stick .
and your eye doesn &apos;t know which level to read .
it was just the name of the child , with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly .
so you can see the surface of every single s@@ watch -- like in this picture of ch@@ u@@ ck close .
actually , i once paid like 60 dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of &quot; king le@@ ar , &quot; and i felt really rob@@ bed , because by the time the actor started being king le@@ ar , he stopped being the great actor that i had paid money to see .
the two human dna sequ@@ ences go back to a common ance@@ stor quite recently .
they &apos;ve sequen@@ ced 18@@ 5 africans from two populations in africa .
so an interesting question is , what happened when we met ?
so that today , the people living outside africa have about two and a half percent of their dna from neanderth@@ als .
we learn perhaps many things , but one thing that i find sort of important to mention is that i think the lesson is that we have always mix@@ ed .
so what we need is space inside the aircraft , inside a very dense area .
so this technology , 3d printing , and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight , which is the biggest issue in aircraft design , because it &apos;s directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions .
we intu@@ it other people &apos;s feelings .
and it &apos;s out of this mu@@ tu@@ ally rein@@ for@@ cing ch@@ ore@@ ograph@@ y that a lot that is of importance to the emergen@@ ce of mind , the social mind , the social brain , depends on .
now , for this girl , that di@@ vision line is not so clear , and the world of people is not attra@@ cting her as much as we would like .
and yet , the medi@@ an age of diagno@@ sis in this country is still about five years , and in dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged populations , the populations that don &apos;t have access to clinical services , rural populations , min@@ orities , the age of diagno@@ sis is later still , which is almost as if i were to tell you that we are con@@ dem@@ ning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe .
in this scan pass , in green here , are two-@@ year-olds with autism .
and we want to do that univers@@ ally so that we don &apos;t miss any child , but this would be im@@ moral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention , for treatment .
and then a jum@@ p@@ master comes , and he &apos;s an experienced n@@ co in par@@ ach@@ ute operations .
so nice air comes flo@@ wing in .
in 30-@@ some years of jum@@ ping , i never did one .
but then a couple of years later , when i was a company com@@ man@@ der , i went out to the national training center .
an emerging opportunity came -- didn &apos;t have time to get everybody together .
and yet , again , you &apos;re not all in one room .
think about it . it &apos;s extra@@ ordin@@ arily powerful .
my overall project is about art -- specifically , about black artists -- very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves .
this is har@@ lem , actually , on january 20th , thinking about itself in a very wonderful way .
really , most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the exc@@ it@@ ement that young artists can bring .
well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement up there .
so the children said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
they are trying to multi@@ p@@ ly , i think .
&quot; did you understand anything ? &quot; &quot; no , nothing . &quot;
what is that ? can you do that again ? can you show me some more ? &apos; &quot; she did that for two months .
the average score when i &apos;d done it with the computers and the groups was 7@@ 6 percent .
they wanted to be foot@@ ball@@ ers before .
this sent shi@@ vers up my sp@@ ine .
and i was in a village where there was an initi@@ ation cer@@ em@@ ony for the young men , a ri@@ te of pas@@ sage .
you saw many examples of my work up there , but it &apos;s one that people know .
and in a way , that is what makes it spiritual .
c@@ ali@@ ban : this island is mine .
and so i could play with the medium , and why i move from one medium to another is to be able to do this .
did you hear the ly@@ ri@@ cs ?
i think that failure can be an incredibly motiv@@ ating force as well , so i moved to kenya and worked in uganda , and i met a group of rwand@@ an women , who asked me , in 198@@ 6 , to move to k@@ ig@@ ali to help them start the first micro@@ finance institution there .
and at the end of it , we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done , and i said , &quot; it is so beautiful . &quot;
i want to tell you two stories . both of them are in africa .
so he moved back to the farm , and , long story short , they now have seven ac@@ res under cul@@ tiv@@ ation .
and so , an@@ u@@ j and acu@@ men have been talking about testing the private sector , because the assu@@ mption that the aid establi@@ sh@@ ment has made is that , look , in a country like tanz@@ ania , 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day .
and my wish , when i see those women , i meet those farmers , and i think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day , is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility , and that they also can believe and get access to services , so that their children , too , can live those lives of great purpose .
now , for those of you who don &apos;t know , a ru@@ be gold@@ berg machine is a complicated contra@@ ption , an incredibly over@@ -@@ engine@@ ered piece of machin@@ ery that accompli@@ sh@@ es a relatively simple task .
and as if that wasn &apos;t enough , all of these incredibly compli@@ cating things , right , they wanted it in one shot .
and so while planning is important , so is flexi@@ bility .
we need some more ridiculous things besi@@ des &quot; the cab@@ in@@ et of natural curi@@ o@@ si@@ ties . &quot;
as a matter of fact , this is by far the most important com@@ mission that leonardo has ever had , and for doing this great master@@ piece , he was named the number one artist influence at the time .
and if you want to sum@@ mar@@ ize in one just single word , well , this is what we &apos;re trying to do .
we indu@@ ce cells , okay , say , skin cells , by adding a few genes to them , cul@@ turing them , and then harv@@ est@@ ing them .
but that &apos;s not even all of it , because once a drug is appro@@ ved , tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more person@@ alized treatments .
and this really is a so@@ ber@@ ing picture upon reali@@ zing that we , humans , are in charge of life on earth ; we &apos;re like the cap@@ ri@@ cious go@@ ds of old gre@@ ek my@@ ths , kind of playing with life -- and not a great deal of wisdom inje@@ cted into it .
we got a lot of people thinking about electric cars , what you could do with them . a few years later , when we suggest@@ ed to g@@ m that now is the time and we could do a thing called the impact , they spon@@ sor@@ ed it , and here &apos;s the impact that we developed with them on their programs . this is the demon@@ str@@ ator . and they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product .
the friendly support , the quiet confidence , con@@ geni@@ al hospit@@ ality shown by our hawa@@ i@@ ian and military ho@@ sts -- this is starting -- made the experience enjo@@ y@@ able and un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
this one doesn &apos;t have the video in it , but you get a little feel from what it can do .
and if we can get some agre@@ ement on where we want the world to be -- des@@ ir@@ able , sustainable when your kids reach your age -- i think we actually can reach it . now , i said this was a war@@ ning , not a for@@ ec@@ ast . that was before -- i painted this before we started in on making robotic ver@@ sions of haw@@ k mo@@ ths and cock@@ ro@@ ach@@ es , and now i &apos;m beginning to wonder seriously -- was this more of a for@@ ec@@ ast than i wanted ?
on the field of battle , we are bra@@ ve and no@@ ble war@@ ri@@ ors .
i explained it to all my friends . ma@@ ths is beautiful .
- 1 = 31 .
lu@@ c@@ as again , in 18@@ 7@@ 6 , showed us - 1 , 21 dig@@ its long , was not prime .
put simply , in a room full of random@@ ly selec@@ ted people , i &apos;m a ma@@ ths genius .
here &apos;s a slide of the first 1,000 dig@@ its of this prime .
it can take a random@@ ly shu@@ ff@@ led ru@@ bi@@ k &apos;s cu@@ be .
we thought it might be there , and we went and found it .
the disease was first si@@ gh@@ ted in the nor@@ the@@ ast of tas@@ man@@ ia in 199@@ 6 and has spread across tas@@ man@@ ia like a huge wave .
i myself had a tumor removed from my large inte@@ st@@ ine when i was only 14 .
so how come a tumor that aro@@ se from the cells of another individual is growing on jon@@ as &apos; face ?
and in fact , these same cells that are affec@@ ting k@@ im@@ bo here are also found affec@@ ting dogs in new york city , in mountain villages in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as and in out@@ back australia .
eli@@ zab@@ eth mur@@ ch@@ ison : fighting a conta@@ gi@@ ous cancer
but private optimis@@ m about our own personal future remains persi@@ stent .
so some people say no .
well if you get the k@@ iss now , it &apos;s over and done with .
if we expect the future to be bright , stress and an@@ x@@ iety are reduced .
but at the same time , when we hear that the housing market is hop@@ eful , we think , &quot; oh , my house is definitely going to double in price . &quot;
then we inter@@ fer@@ ed with the brain region that we found to integra@@ te good news in this task , and the optimis@@ m bias disappeared .
because if you &apos;re one of these p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly , you certainly never will .
now that &apos;s a big abstract number .
power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want , and you can do it in three ways .
indeed , people were over@@ -@@ enthusi@@ a@@ stic in the early 200@@ 0s , thinking america could do anything , which led us into some dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous foreign policy ad@@ vent@@ ures , and now we &apos;re back to decline again .
but you might ask , well so what in any case ?
top board : military power among states .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just zero sum , but positive sum .
and thir@@ dly , what is the ex@@ it strategy for the peac@@ e@@ kee@@ pers ?
and so now let me suggest two compli@@ ment@@ ary approach@@ es to changing the reality of the situations .
elections produce a loser , who is then exclu@@ ded .
jobs .
what might the bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ cks be ?
so that &apos;s a way to get basic services sc@@ aled up .
gradu@@ ally it would shift from a politics of pl@@ under to a politics of hope . thank you .
that &apos;s the russi@@ ans plan@@ ting a flag on the ocean bottom to sta@@ ke a claim for miner@@ als under the re@@ ce@@ ding arctic sea ice .
ox@@ fa@@ m and s@@ wis@@ s re , together with rock@@ ef@@ eller foundation , are helping farmers like this one build h@@ ill@@ side ter@@ ra@@ ces and find other ways to conser@@ ve water , but they &apos;re also providing for insurance when the dr@@ ou@@ ghts do come .
other examples to consider . in the u.k. , the th@@ ames bar@@ rier prote@@ cts london from storm sur@@ ge .
let &apos;s start with beat@@ le man@@ ia : hy@@ ster@@ ical teenagers , crying , scre@@ aming , pan@@ demon@@ ium .
why english ? in a single word : opportunity .
and now english is becoming the language of proble@@ m-@@ solving .
and then they found , in 18@@ 98 , that they &apos;d put about five bul@@ lets in the bu@@ ll@@ se@@ ye in a minute .
and he was interested , effectively , in what he could do with those concrete objects .
now , not only do we have much more education , and much of that education is scientific , and you can &apos;t do science without classi@@ fying the world .
compare the ban@@ ker in 1900 , who really just needed a good accoun@@ t@@ ant and to know who was tru@@ st@@ worthy in the local community for paying back their mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge .
in other words , they were fixed in the concrete mor@@ es and at@@ titudes they had inher@@ ited .
the simil@@ ari@@ ties sub@@ test of the wech@@ s@@ ler is about classi@@ fication , and we have made enormous ga@@ ins on that classi@@ fication sub@@ test .
you know , the span@@ ish didn &apos;t sin@@ k the bat@@ t@@ les@@ hip ma@@ ine , the lu@@ si@@ tan@@ ia was not an inno@@ cent ves@@ sel but was lo@@ aded with m@@ uni@@ tions , the north viet@@ nam@@ ese did not attack the se@@ vent@@ h fle@@ et , and , of course , sad@@ dam hus@@ sein hat@@ ed al q@@ ae@@ da and had nothing to do with it , and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people that they were brothers in arms , when he would hang one from the near@@ est lam@@ p@@ post .
and we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plo@@ wing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
her answer set the temp@@ late for the entire career i was to have after that .
and i have that kind of fl@@ ash sometimes .
we put all the problems of the world there , and i thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
there &apos;s oil sp@@ ills , environmental dis@@ ast@@ ers , water rights dis@@ pu@@ tes , break@@ away republi@@ cs , fam@@ ine , en@@ danger@@ ed species and global warming .
well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
but come to find out , a few game days later -- and there are turns where we take negoti@@ ation from a team -- actually there &apos;s a negoti@@ ation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negoti@@ ation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
i &apos;ll show you what my friend david says about this .
there was no way they could win .
every game we play is different .
many people were inspired by this .
you can just pull this out , this becomes a rec@@ tan@@ gle .
you can make a jo@@ int of four . you can make a jo@@ int of six .
and this is the other one -- that you just take a stra@@ w , and you just put a stick inside and you make two half-@@ cu@@ ts .
now this is a pen@@ cil with a few s@@ lots over here .
this is a permanent mag@@ net .
so no one actually needs to mu@@ ck up the production of sound with wire vibra@@ tions .
there will be a sp@@ inning magnetic field .
and the second night , he would take the same cap and give it another fold .
and to make that , it involves extre@@ mes of temperature , extre@@ mes of pressure and lo@@ ads of pollution .
and in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pres@@ su@@ ri@@ zed membran@@ es .
and i &apos;m just going to talk through this animation .
and during the evolution of life on the earth , it was the coloni@@ zation of the land by plants that helped create the ben@@ ig@@ n climate we currently enjoy .
so it was like a green in@@ k@@ b@@ lot spreading out from the building turning bar@@ ren land back into bi@@ ologically productive land -- and in that sense , going beyond sustainable design to achieve re@@ stor@@ ative design .
and that buil@@ ds up on the ev@@ a@@ por@@ ators -- and that &apos;s what that image on the left is -- gradu@@ ally getting en@@ cru@@ sted with the cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate .
and that &apos;s what we need to do , so let &apos;s be positive , and let &apos;s make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation we &apos;ve ever seen .
i was looking for somebody who was jewish , because that &apos;s what i am and that was important to me .
so obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward .
and as it happens , the algorithms that were setting us up , they weren &apos;t bad either .
so once i had all this done , i then built a sc@@ oring system , because what i wanted to do was to sort of mathema@@ tically calculate whether or not i thought the guy that i found online would be a match with me .
i only wanted data on the women who were going to be attra@@ cted to the type of man that i really , really wanted to mar@@ ry .
and as it turns out , i did a really good job .
they should be flu@@ ff@@ y , not hard . &quot;
i &apos;d like to put this kind of fri@@ day night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab .
&#91; &quot; board &quot; &#93; audience : red@@ .@@ da@@ ph@@ ne ba@@ ve@@ li@@ er : red .
so your typical normal young adult can have a sp@@ an of about three or four objects of attention .
so we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game .
it doesn &apos;t really feel like playing mind@@ less action video games .
well , i myself have spent the past 30 years of my life working on three large projects that really try to take the idea of compu@@ tation seriously .
most of them do very simple things , but if you look along all these different pictures , at rule number 30 , you start to see something interesting going on .
and last year we were able to release the first website version of wolfra@@ m alpha .
but the goal is to go much further and , very broad@@ ly , to democra@@ ti@@ ze all of this knowledge , and to try and be an auth@@ or@@ it@@ ative source in all areas .
let me show you a couple of examples here .
well , it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing in the compu@@ tational universe .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited to discover that there are candi@@ date univer@@ ses with incredibly simple rules that success@@ fully re@@ produce special rela@@ tivity , and even general rela@@ tivity and gravi@@ tation , and at least give hin@@ ts of quantum mechan@@ ics .
does your work relate to his ?
this was in the 90s during the peak of the hiv epidemic , before there were any ar@@ v@@ s in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
these people are tall .
but when my father came , he would sell the co@@ ws , he would sell the products we had , and he went and dr@@ ank with his friends in the bars .
it &apos;s a cer@@ em@@ ony . people are enjo@@ ying it .
there is something about clothes , i think , and shoes .
&quot; well , dad , i need help . can you support me to go to america ? &quot;
and the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is ra@@ ped when she &apos;s walking to school , the mother is bl@@ amed for that .
as a new da@@ wn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening .
and yet , at the same time , this very well may be a semin@@ al moment in american history , an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajec@@ tory in america .
so consumers got over@@ le@@ ver@@ a@@ ged .
i &apos;ll give you some examples . lets talk about den@@ ti@@ sts , vas@@ ec@@ tom@@ ies , g@@ uns and shark attacks . okay ?
but seriously , we also have this phenomenon on ma@@ dis@@ on a@@ ven@@ ue and in other places , where people are actually walking out of lux@@ ury b@@ ou@@ ti@@ ques with ordinary , sort of gener@@ ic paper bags to hide the brand pur@@ ch@@ ases .
the consumer is dem@@ anding it .
did you know that 6@@ 8 percent of americans now carry a library card ?
it &apos;s now about connecting to your communities , connecting to your social networks .
and there is lots of really interesting examples here that we see .
so , when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we &apos;re seeing in our data , we see a very hop@@ eful picture for the future of america .
why can i say , &quot; i &apos;ll take my ste@@ ak medium rare , i need size six shoes , &quot; but i won &apos;t say , &quot; would you pra@@ ise me this way ? &quot;
and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great hus@@ b@@ ands , great mothers , friends , daughters , sons .
now , i &apos;m aware that i should not be saying such things in front of an audience of schol@@ ars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , i did not see anyone go back un@@ happy or un@@ heal@@ ed .
i was an intro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of communic@@ ating with color@@ ed cra@@ y@@ ons and apo@@ logi@@ zing to objects when i bu@@ mp@@ ed into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day experiences and emotions .
i lived in a very vi@@ br@@ ant , diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my no@@ vels .
but instead of sett@@ ling down , i went to ari@@ zon@@ a .
when identity politics tries to put lab@@ els on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
one is interested in s@@ wee@@ ping gener@@ ali@@ zations .
like that , my fiction as well .
they connect all humanity , regar@@ d@@ less of identity politics , and that is the good news .
last one , this is &quot; who &apos;s going to buy you ri@@ bb@@ ons , &quot; another traditional fol@@ k tun@@ e .
that &apos;s multi-@@ touch , controlling a device by tou@@ ching its display .
for example ...
thank you .
the second house ever built is house number two .
you see there , it &apos;s about 6@@ 20 billion a year .
that &apos;s fascinating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the mechanism for power@@ ing those foun@@ tains requires there to be la@@ kes of liquid water bene@@ ath the surface of this moon .
well , there is .
and so the fact that atoms , when you heat them up , only e@@ mit light at very specific colors , was one of the key dri@@ vers that led to the development of the quantum theory , the theory of the structure of atoms .
there are a billion stars in the gal@@ ac@@ tic core , which is why it &apos;s sh@@ ining out so bri@@ ghtly .
this is a spectacular picture of our home planet .
on it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was lived out their lives .
and increasingly , the price we &apos;re being asked to pay for all of this connec@@ te@@ dness is our priv@@ acy .
i then go to a news site , look for some head@@ lines .
imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a not@@ e@@ book and recorded their every movement .
but i turned around because i didn &apos;t recognize where my voice was coming from .
they &apos;re back in phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a .
it &apos;s only 500 miles .
but i use that story because they really wanted to help me .
but something happened -- ex@@ x@@ on val@@ de@@ z .
how could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
it took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , i had become a prison@@ er .
so , let &apos;s go out into the world and take this car@@ ing , this love , this respect that we &apos;ve shown each other right here at ted , and take this out into the world .
my daily life became very hard , but very simple .
i decided to cross during the day , first because i was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because i knew i was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , i thought i might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
when i looked down at my plate , i saw the last chicken wing , that my fo@@ ster father had given me his .
this is my message to you .
thank you .
we stayed there for six years without paying any r@@ ent .
they &apos;re so poor , and they are free@@ zing with blan@@ ke@@ ts during the rain@@ y season , in the shel@@ ters built by the u.n. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refuge@@ es had to cut the trees , and just like this .
he said , &quot; as long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot;
mr. ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i brought g@@ 8 sum@@ mit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and i got half a million euro@@ s from the japanese government to re@@ build this temporary audi@@ tor@@ ium .
long before sustainability became a bu@@ zz@@ word , architect shi@@ ger@@ u ban had be@@ gun his experiments with ecolo@@ gi@@ call@@ y-@@ sound building materials such as car@@ d@@ board tu@@ bes and paper . his remarkable structures are often intended as temporary housing , designed to help the dis@@ pos@@ s@@ essed in dis@@ a@@ ster@@ -@@ struck nations such as haiti , rwanda or japan . yet equally often the buildings remain a belo@@ ved part of the landscape long after they have ser@@ ved their intended purpose .
but the pregnant woman &apos;s own voice rever@@ ber@@ ates through her body , reaching the fe@@ tus much more re@@ adi@@ ly .
the off@@ spring of the car@@ rot ju@@ ice drinking women ate more car@@ ro@@ t-@@ fla@@ vor@@ ed cer@@ e@@ al , and from the looks of it , they seemed to enjoy it more .
the opening of the na@@ zi &apos;s sie@@ ge was followed by one of the har@@ sh@@ est w@@ inter@@ s in decades -- so cold the water in the can@@ als fro@@ ze solid .
the real trouble comes when pregnant women are , in a sense , un@@ reli@@ able nar@@ rat@@ ors , when fe@@ t@@ uses are led to expect a world of scar@@ city and are born instead into a world of plenty .
thank you .
je@@ an ro@@ ber@@ t-@@ hou@@ din : a con@@ jur@@ er is not a ju@@ g@@ gl@@ er .
that makes my job more difficult , because , if i want to surprise them , i need to tell a story that starts the same , but ends differently -- a trick with a twi@@ st on a twi@@ st .
this is my brother , jon@@ ny . he &apos;s 10 , and he plays the ban@@ jo .
quite nice in itself , they &apos;re little , sort of , airplane things .
so what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very , very large budget .
i said , &quot; when people log@@ in to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they &apos;d probably quite like to look at .
you know , there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accompli@@ sh quite a lot .
late at night , after hours of practic@@ ing , i would listen to jan@@ is j@@ op@@ lin and bil@@ lie holi@@ day as the sounds of tan@@ go music would be cre@@ eping from my parents &apos; stere@@ o .
so what i &apos;m going to show you how to do is how to create one with a wi@@ i remote .
the stories we tell about each other matter very much .
i heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor .
when i heard him speak , it was three years before that .
maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when i came as their gu@@ est and that made them feel proud .
we said , &quot; our little experiment has been a success .
the first one is , as i mentioned , entreprene@@ ur@@ ship was a new idea to me .
that &apos;s around 130 billion dollars a year -- it &apos;s a lot .
and i think we know that love is resili@@ ent enough for us to get out there and try .
if we extra@@ po@@ late back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago .
the earth was formed 4@@ .@@ 6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years .
indeed , it has probably given me more time than most people to pur@@ sue the quest for knowledge .
when &apos;s the last time you really enjo@@ yed just the voice of your friend ?
and i remember reading that book , and at 3 in the morning i was reading this book and it was explaining how the anten@@ n@@ as i was using to measure the sp@@ ins of galaxies could also be used to communicate , to send bits of information from one star system to another .
in fact , it &apos;s dou@@ bling every 18 months , and , of course , every car@@ d-@@ carrying member of the di@@ ger@@ at@@ i knows that that &apos;s moore &apos;s law .
well , at 9 : 30 in the morning , with my head down on my desk because i obviously hadn &apos;t sle@@ pt all night , the phone r@@ ings and it &apos;s the new york times .
and they &apos;re just doing it because they want to explore , and you might say , &quot; oh , that &apos;s kind of a fri@@ vol@@ ous opportunity , &quot; but that &apos;s not fri@@ vol@@ ous . that &apos;s not a fri@@ vol@@ ous activity , because , i mean , think of ants .
and probably most of the people wouldn &apos;t even know the value of a s@@ wis@@ s fran@@ c , okay ?
here i am at about 15 or something , doing that sort of stuff .
and i say that not because i am african , but it &apos;s in africa that you find the earli@@ est evidence for human ancestors , up@@ right walking tra@@ ces , even the first technologies in the form of stone tools .
because it &apos;s only when you do that , that you can talk about -- -- it &apos;s only when you do that , &#91; that &#93; you can talk about how we looked like and how we beha@@ ved at different times , and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time .
you either don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for , or you &apos;re looking in the wrong place , &quot; he said .
so she belon@@ gs to our family tree , but within that , of course , you do deta@@ iled analysis , and we know now that she belon@@ gs to the lu@@ cy species , known as austr@@ al@@ op@@ i@@ the@@ cus af@@ ar@@ en@@ sis .
but that care means also you learn .
of course , in addition to extra@@ cting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human , you know , the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 -- they did not have the knowledge , the technology and sophisti@@ cations that we , homo sa@@ pi@@ ens , have today .
instead , they just make me green with en@@ vy that my colleague from i@@ u@@ c@@ n was able to go on this journey to the south of ma@@ da@@ gas@@ car se@@ amounts to actually take photographs and to see these won@@ dr@@ ous creatures of the deep .
that is , we &apos;re able to save it from a fa@@ te of deep@@ -@@ sea bottom tra@@ w@@ ling .
so anything in the water is treated as if it &apos;s the high seas .
we need to work lo@@ cally , but we also need to work oce@@ an-@@ bas@@ in-@@ wide .
but we need to think broad@@ -@@ scale . we need to think globally .
so here we are , seven years , 500 interviews later , and i &apos;m gon@@ na tell you what really leads to success and makes ted-@@ sters ti@@ ck .
now a lot of kids tell me they want to be million@@ air@@ es .
right now there are 48 hours of video being u@@ plo@@ aded to youtube every single minute .
well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat com@@ ical .
and arch@@ ie coch@@ ran@@ e , as the camp doctor , was one of the first men in to clear up the mess .
and the next morning , supp@@ lies of vitam@@ in b@@ 12 are deli@@ vered to the camp , and the prison@@ ers begin to re@@ cover .
this is produced by the physicist c@@ es@@ ar hi@@ d@@ al@@ go .
so this is the complexity of the world that surro@@ unds us .
well you have this great big tank full of liquid deter@@ gent .
we have no idea why it works , no idea at all .
and there &apos;s an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher &apos;s desk who knows all the answers .
and after the trial had been running for a little while , he gather@@ ed together all his colleagues around his table , and he said , &quot; well , gentlemen , we have some pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary results .
it isn &apos;t easy .
there are many sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ based analy@@ ses of this , but they all draw the same conclusion -- that we &apos;re living beyond our means .
there are so many ways we can improve the way we do things .
and that &apos;s what will happen to us .
but we see , mista@@ ken@@ ly , each of these issues as individual problems to be solved .
maybe fear .
i wanted to know what that would take , so i worked with professor jor@@ gen r@@ anders from nor@@ way to find the answer .
well it &apos;s time to grow up , to be wis@@ er , to be cal@@ mer , like generations before us , we &apos;ll be growing up in war -- not a war between civili@@ zations , but a war for civilization , for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier and plans on sta@@ ying around into middle age .
it turns out that b of a in september had 32 times .
and then all be@@ ts are off .
we &apos;ve got to qu@@ it bor@@ ro@@ wing as much , because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole p@@ ie .
and let me rec@@ ap some of the stuff you &apos;ve seen .
they tried to engineer bacteri@@ as in such a way that they would act as your ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys .
i mean , you understand where this story &apos;s going .
you &apos;ve also got flies , the size of flies , that are being made by robert wood at harvard .
it is a natural state in everything that is alive , including hom@@ ini@@ ds .
but the worst thing about it was that you couldn &apos;t use it on the yo@@ un@@ gest children , on in@@ fan@@ ts , and on one-@@ year-olds .
and the parents were very un@@ happy , and they said , &quot; this is a terrible thing , because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing ? &quot; and the government was very up@@ set .
and that &apos;s that middle set of bars .
and it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country , none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said , some expli@@ cit@@ ly , some not so expli@@ cit@@ ly , &quot; all of our business comes from car seat manufac@@ tur@@ ers .
anyway , it turns out that those two crash@@ es , that actually the three-@@ year-old did slightly worse . so , he gets about a 500 out of -- you know , on this range -- relative to a 400 and something .
you &apos;ve got a regular seat for adults , and then you fold it down , and the kid si@@ ts on top , and it &apos;s integrated .
in the new jer@@ sey data , which is different , because it &apos;s not just fat@@ al crash@@ es , but all crash@@ es in new jer@@ sey that are reported , it turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in inju@@ ries , but generally they &apos;re the min@@ or inju@@ ries .
it &apos;s impossible in theory , but possible in practice .
that &apos;s a lot of stor@@ age , memory . nine ex@@ ab@@ y@@ te ra@@ m .
and so in some ways , all you really need is a clou@@ d@@ book .
and so one of the consequences of that , i believe , is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now -- tv , film , video -- that basically becomes one media platform .
so you were for@@ war@@ ding on . you didn &apos;t have control .
there &apos;s like a billion social sites on the web .
and we kind of object at first , saying , &quot; oh , that &apos;s awful . &quot;
we &apos;ll have a better word for it .
i started going out on cases .
the thing i had to admit to myself , with great re@@ pul@@ sion , was that i get it .
but it &apos;s a human problem . it &apos;s a scientific problem , if you will .
and those things are the refle@@ ction of the processes , and the time that they are made .
this is a project that we just finished in pen@@ ang for a very , very large city project that came directly out of this process , which is the result of the multipli@@ city of forces that produce it .
and this was the first prototype in korea , as we &apos;re dealing with a dynamic en@@ vel@@ ope , and then the same characteri@@ stic of the fabric .
and now it turned into something much , much bro@@ a@@ der as a problem , and it has to do with performance .
there it is mod@@ eled as it was developing into a piece of work .
and a project that was realized in au@@ stri@@ a , the ho@@ oper bank , which again used this idea of connecting ty@@ po@@ log@@ y , the traditional buildings , and mor@@ ph@@ ology , or the relationship of the development of land as an idea , into a complex , which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this aug@@ ment@@ ing , this movement of the land that &apos;s a very simple idea of just li@@ f@@ ting it up and occu@@ p@@ ying it , and other parts are much more ener@@ ge@@ tic and intense .
you &apos;ll find a sta@@ ir that &apos;s the same length as the su@@ pre@@ me court .
so i would suggest that we change how we classi@@ fy ourselves .
we popul@@ ated all the ecolo@@ gi@@ es .
but of course , they are har@@ d-@@ wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way .
this is the layer which actually tou@@ ches the food you are s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wing and you di@@ gest , which is actually the lu@@ men .
at least in my case , they are not listen@@ ed to .
so our research -- and i think the research also at the universi@@ ties -- are now fix@@ ing on these points to say : how can we actually -- and this might sound trivi@@ al now to you -- how can we change cooking ?
we all have to deal with the mystery of death , the world that wa@@ its beyond death , the el@@ ders who fall away into their el@@ derly years .
i tra@@ v@@ elled for a month in ne@@ pal with our good friend , mat@@ th@@ ie@@ u ri@@ card , and you &apos;ll remember mat@@ th@@ ie@@ u fam@@ ously said to all of us here once at ted , &quot; western science is a major response to min@@ or needs . &quot;
and for one day , he we@@ ars the clo@@ thing of his sister and he becomes a trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te , a wa@@ y@@ la@@ ka . and for that day , he leads all ab@@ le-@@ bo@@ died men on a run , but it &apos;s not your ordinary run .
and where does the river rise ?
the other side is plan@@ ted like that by the men . metaph@@ or@@ ically , you turn it on the side , and you have a piece of cl@@ oth .
and we ran into a far@@ c pat@@ ro@@ l at da@@ wn , so it was quite har@@ ro@@ wing .
our industrial society is sc@@ arc@@ ely 300 years old .
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year , in everything from building materials to sur@@ f@@ boards to coffee cu@@ ps to table tops .
when a tree &apos;s done using its leaves -- its solar colle@@ ctors , these amazing molecular phot@@ on cap@@ turing devices -- at the end of a season , it doesn &apos;t pack them up , take them to the lea@@ f re@@ processing center and have them mel@@ ted down to form new leaves .
this gives us a continu@@ ous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape , though today we &apos;re making corner blocks .
the next is self-@@ assembly , because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process .
the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye , you can use it to store massive amounts of data , and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was strug@@ gling to explain .
now , the idea is not as crazy as it sounds .
it di@@ stra@@ cts them with pretty pictures , ir@@ relevant data .
but unlike the other speakers , i &apos;m not going to tell you about the myster@@ ies of the universe , or the wonder@@ s of evolution , or the really clever , innovative ways people are attac@@ king the major ine@@ qualities in our world .
she told this to one of her colleagues , who said , &quot; well , what does your boy@@ friend do ? &quot;
the next time , after the 15@@ th to@@ ss .
if you went head@@ -@@ tail@@ -@@ head@@ -@@ tail@@ -@@ head , you can c@@ un@@ n@@ ingly get two oc@@ curr@@ ences of the pattern in only five to@@ s@@ ses .
it &apos;s a very , very simple example , an easily st@@ ated question in probability , which every -- you &apos;re in good company -- everybody gets wrong .
to try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases .
amongst these million individuals , most of them are healthy and some of them will have the disease .
and just to set it in context , you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child , and then two , if they &apos;re inno@@ cent , to be con@@ vi@@ cted of mur@@ der@@ ing them .
and the other one was the chance , a prior@@ i , that the person had the disease or not .
it &apos;s very well docum@@ ented that people get things wrong .
in other sp@@ her@@ es of life , if people argu@@ ed -- well , except possibly for politics -- but in other sp@@ her@@ es of life , if people argu@@ ed il@@ logi@@ cally , we &apos;d say that &apos;s not a good thing .
so here is what we did . we put a 10-@@ cent digital trans@@ pon@@ der , a data tag , in the appli@@ ance plu@@ g .
and also , i talked to friends about china and chinese internet .
but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple .
he allowed facebook , a u.@@ s@@ .@@ -@@ based service , to continue to stay on inside of tun@@ isi@@ a .
but in english it &apos;s 20 words or a sentence with a short link .
but now we have weib@@ o , so i call it the weib@@ o pe@@ ti@@ tion .
they have everything in their hands .
but this technology is very new , but techni@@ cally is very old .
now when we think of our senses , we don &apos;t usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved , from a biological perspective .
she &apos;s in a very suppor@@ tive environment .
this is her 10 years later .
in fact , most im@@ plant users really struggle and dis@@ like music because it sounds so bad .
you dist@@ ort it a little bit , especially in terms of pit@@ ch , and you &apos;ve changed it .
i had patients tell me that those sound the same .
and this is of a student of mine named joseph who i had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab .
and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of re@@ stor@@ ing perfect hearing .
i did not choose to take up the pen , the brush , the camera .
and i want to tell you how this gun can help .
then in high school , i was gri@@ pped by the stories of the al@@ lied soldiers -- soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and ris@@ ked their lives to liber@@ ate a country and a people that they didn &apos;t know .
such a state mon@@ opo@@ ly on violence , first of all , ser@@ ves as a reas@@ sur@@ ance .
every day i hope that politicians , diplo@@ ma@@ ts , development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope .
so that &apos;s great . so that was too easy .
i mix them together , add a little bit of salt water , and then add this long strand i was telling you about , that i &apos;ve stol@@ en from a virus . and then what happens is , you heat this whole thing up to about bo@@ iling . you cool it down to room temperature , and as you do , what happens is those short str@@ ands , they do the following thing : each one of them bin@@ ds that long strand in one place , and then has a second half that bin@@ ds that long strand in a distant place , and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together .
fri@@ ction clim@@ bing doesn &apos;t have any sort of hard positive ed@@ ges .
rule number five : know how to rest .
i &apos;ve been quite interested in both .
but if you ask me , what will it cost for one mi@@ ps of computing in 2010 , or the cost to sequence a base pair of dna in 2012 , or the cost of sending a me@@ gab@@ y@@ te of data wir@@ el@@ ess@@ ly in 20@@ 14 , it turns out that those are very predictable .
and then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions , and biological evolution kept acceler@@ ating .
whole different paradigm -- transi@@ stors came out of the wo@@ od@@ work .
in terms of price performance , that &apos;s a 40 to 50 percent def@@ lation rate .
there are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of plac@@ ing the genetic material in the right place on the chromo@@ some .
you could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours -- so , &quot; honey , i &apos;m in the pool , &quot; will take on a whole new meaning .
wall street noticed that this was a revolution@@ ary technology , which it was , but then six months later , when it hadn &apos;t revolution@@ ized all business models , they figured , well , that was wrong , and then we had this b@@ ust .
but most importantly , it &apos;ll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct mer@@ ger with our technology , which in some sense we &apos;re doing already .
this device , the ade 6@@ 5@@ 1 , was sold to the ira@@ q@@ i government for 4@@ 0,000 dollars ap@@ ie@@ ce .
our second type of error is a false negative .
or is it more like a frog ?
there actually is something here , but it &apos;s degra@@ ded .
dopam@@ ine , i think , changes our sign@@ al-@@ to-@@ noise rati@@ o .
and you see the lam@@ p here , i know .
but anyway , the point is still made .
the intelligent designer &apos;s always portra@@ yed as this super intelligent , moral being that comes down to design life .
our agen@@ tic@@ ity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these .
now , what i &apos;m going to be looking for in this test is how it prote@@ cts your li@@ ps , the tex@@ ture , right , and maybe if you can disc@@ ern any fla@@ vor or not .
so , witness was started in &apos; 9@@ 2 and it &apos;s since given cameras out in over 60 countries .
i fell . they ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead .
there could be a new movement growing up , rising from the ground , reaching for the light , and growing strong , just like a tree . thank you .
the first is how it de@@ als with this obstac@@ le that we &apos;ve put in its way . see , look , it does a little dance , and then it car@@ ries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place .
that was what was of interest to us next .
it isn &apos;t clim@@ bing . it isn &apos;t dancing , because its body temperature is actually relatively low .
on the way home , he knows where home is , and he wants to go straight to it .
we don &apos;t know yet what dung beet@@ les use .
actually , a lot of things are better with fire in my world , but the fire &apos;s just a foundation .
i &apos;m going to wave through the kin@@ e@@ ct here and take control , and now i &apos;m going to reach out and i &apos;m going to touch a star , and when i do , it will play the sentence that generated that star .
designer j@@ ared fi@@ ck@@ lin creates wild visu@@ ali@@ zations that let us see music , using color and even fire to analy@@ ze how sound makes us feel . he takes a brief di@@ gression to analy@@ ze the sound of a sk@@ ate@@ park -- and how audio can clu@@ e us in to developing creativity .
m@@ all@@ ory &apos;s argument that leaving the house , embar@@ king on these grand ad@@ vent@@ ures is jo@@ y@@ ful and fun , however , doesn &apos;t t@@ ally that ne@@ at@@ ly with my own experience .
this is a photo of cap@@ tain scott and his team .
good morning . my name is david rose .
you &apos;ve got to con@@ vey passion .
there are very few people who have the full set of skills that it takes to run a company .
it starts off , you walk in the door .
you want to tie in to the rest of the world out there .
bill gates &apos; power@@ point presentation over here .
and you &apos;re focused on me and why i &apos;m such a great guy , and why you want to invest in me .
no , never do a live dem@@ o .
but then comes the ask .
if you use apple &apos;s key@@ note , it &apos;s got an even better version in key@@ note .
i went to an online en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia , wikipedia , and i entered the term &quot; earth . &quot;
chim@@ bor@@ a@@ z@@ o !
yeah .
pan tro@@ glo@@ dy@@ tes , the name we give him , means &quot; cave d@@ w@@ eller . &quot;
what this means is that if you could shr@@ ink the earth to the size of a billi@@ ard ball , if you could take planet earth , with all its mountain tops and ca@@ ves and rain@@ forests , astron@@ au@@ ts and un@@ cont@@ ac@@ ted tribes and chimpanzees , vo@@ o@@ do@@ o doll@@ s , fire@@ flies , chocolate , sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea , you just shr@@ ink that to the size of a billi@@ ard ball , it would be as smo@@ oth as a billi@@ ard ball , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly a billi@@ ard ball with a s@@ light bul@@ ge around the middle .
where do we r@@ ank three weeks ago in another report by the o@@ ec@@ d ?
in case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like .
step two : we get the baby . woo@@ ho@@ o !
auto@@ cra@@ tic -- do what i say because i &apos;m the chef .
rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
we &apos;re designed to do that continu@@ ously -- to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
we have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
what happens ? they give better service -- not worse , but better .
well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the r@@ ank@@ ings for best emplo@@ yer for small business .
you know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven for@@ bi@@ d .
so i understand that this meeting was plan@@ ned , and the slo@@ gan was from was to still .
well , to describe our prof@@ ession otherwise , we are actually concerned with the play@@ ful search for beauty .
first i set up a shop in my own garden , and made po@@ tter@@ y which i sold on the market@@ place in bu@@ da@@ p@@ est .
this was my first job .
my archi@@ ve : 17@@ 5 films , my 16@@ -@@ millimeter negative , all my books , my dad &apos;s books , my photographs .
that &apos;s my daughter , je@@ an .
my children , da@@ vey and henry .
and we feel like some of that difficul@@ ty was because of this false adverti@@ se@@ ment around par@@ enting .
the baby was coming , and i was ready for this ma@@ ck truck of love to just kno@@ ck me off my feet .
av : yes , and i often joke with ru@@ f@@ us when he comes home that i &apos;m not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a lin@@ e-@@ up amongst other babies .
so al@@ is@@ a &apos;s experience is not isol@@ ated .
there &apos;s really no cer@@ em@@ ony , ritu@@ als , or ri@@ tes .
and so we all remember as children , the tin@@ i@@ est little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children -- the teen@@ i@@ est little thing can just rocket them to these hei@@ ghts of just u@@ tter a@@ du@@ lation , and then the next teen@@ i@@ est little thing can cause them just to plum@@ met to the dep@@ ths of des@@ pair .
and so the final question that we would ask is : can we colle@@ ctively bend that happiness chart up@@ wards ?
but the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers , and what instruments they were using .
how about that ?
here &apos;s now something we know in spectacular quality .
it says right now , we think music is notes and how they &apos;re played .
and on the sweet spot on the stage , tat@@ um starts playing ...
i &apos;ve got a very conf@@ used background which perhaps makes me appropriate for conf@@ used times .
and i think one of the lessons of history is that even the deep@@ est cris@@ es can be moments of opportunity .
like the ma@@ yor of s@@ ã@@ o pau@@ l@@ o who &apos;s ban@@ ned advertising bil@@ l@@ boards , or the many cities like san francisco putting in infra@@ structures for electric cars .
now , what he did didn &apos;t used to have a name , but i think it &apos;s rapidly becoming quite main@@ stream .
it will become more involved in social investment , and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others , not just from what you sell to them , and from relationships as well as from consumption .
ge@@ off mul@@ gan : post-@@ crash , invest@@ ing in a better world
if we were speaking mand@@ ar@@ in chinese with each other , though , i wouldn &apos;t have that lux@@ ury .
you speak english , a fu@@ tured language .
so for example , there is the survey of health , &#91; aging &#93; and reti@@ rement in europe .
yes , fu@@ tur@@ eless language speakers , even after this level of control , are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year .
well actually , i hope for a while longer yet .
okay .
so the books are in english , the journ@@ als are done in english , but that is a self-@@ ful@@ filling prophe@@ cy .
so immediately , we &apos;re reje@@ cting them .
and anyway , there was never enough ker@@ o@@ sen@@ e , because what does a dollar a day buy for you ?
but that began thinking about how birds went around , and then how air@@ planes would , how hang gli@@ ders would fly , and then other planes , and the idea of the go@@ ss@@ amer@@ -@@ con@@ dor@@ -@@ type airplane quickly emerged , was so logical , one should have thought of it in the first place , but one didn &apos;t . and it was just , keep the weight down -- 70 pounds was all it weigh@@ ed -- but let the size s@@ well up , like a hang gli@@ der , but three times the sp@@ an , three times the cor@@ d .
the green line goes down . that &apos;s the wild nature portion .
we focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future , and we produced products for the company .
let &apos;s have the next video .
and this , we just wanted to show you -- if we can get the video running on this , yeah -- just an example of a little video sur@@ vei@@ llan@@ ce .
and as@@ ang@@ a lived 800 years after the buddha &apos;s time .
and he again leaves , and this time : water dri@@ pping , making a giant bow@@ l in the rock where it dri@@ ps in a stream .
so he says , &quot; well , i &apos;ll put my ton@@ gue on the dog &apos;s fl@@ es@@ h .
ma@@ it@@ re@@ ya then took him to a certain heaven , which is the typical way a budd@@ h@@ ist my@@ th un@@ fol@@ ds .
so , we sort of reduce a little of the cl@@ inging to the ones we love -- just in the medi@@ tation -- and we open our mind to those we don &apos;t know .
you will even we@@ ep , perhaps , with gra@@ titude and kin@@ dness .
and then you realize they don &apos;t even have compassion on themselves .
in the great teaching of his hol@@ iness the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a that he always teach@@ es everywhere , he says that that is the common religion of humanity : kin@@ dness .
so , what is simplicity ?
one answer would be : because the kin@@ e@@ tic energy of the water molecules is high and they boun@@ ce against things rapidly -- that &apos;s a kind of physical science argument .
these are cars and dri@@ vers . they dis@@ si@@ pa@@ te energy .
the internet starts with mathematics , it starts with bin@@ ary .
in boston ... boston is a little bit like nam@@ i@@ bia in its cell phone co@@ verage , so that we &apos;re not accu@@ stom@@ ed to that all the time , but some of the time .
but if you have something that has a function , and it &apos;s really cheap , people will find new ways of putting it together to make new things .
and i think that &apos;s a very good way of thinking about the problem .
all right . well , thank you so much for your talk . thank you .
they can say &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; to the invention .
if you want to find the big new ideas , it &apos;s often difficult to find them in main@@ stream markets , in big organizations .
this has huge organi@@ za@@ tional implications for very large areas of life .
that is why the competition with microsoft is bo@@ und to come -- will only come -- from an open-source kind of project .
what &apos;s the role of the bb@@ c , for instance , in that world ?
if , for some reason , your credit card boun@@ ces , or there &apos;s some other problem , you lose your character .
and the way that i &apos;ve been doing it has been multi@@ fac@@ et@@ ed .
ze frank : so -- yeah .
it &apos;s been an interesting two weeks . &quot;
i guess the shoes came off when he was hit .
&quot; i voted blue . i voted red .
so the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter &apos;s room at some point , and she actually was singing that song to herself .
hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine so i asked people whether they had basic audio cap@@ abilities , just so they could sing along to the song with head@@ phones on , so i could just get their voices back .
and what came up was a number of pieces of data .
theore@@ tically what this means is that in order to express this gene , in a violent way , very early on , before pu@@ ber@@ ty , you have to be involved in something that is really trau@@ matic -- not a little stress , not being span@@ ked or something , but really seeing violence , or being involved in it , in 3d .
and that book is very interesting . because it &apos;s about wi@@ tch trials , and how people thought back then .
over 10,000 physi@@ ci@@ sts and engineers from 85 countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine .
absolutely everything .
just up the road .
i &apos;ll make it easier , actually , by blo@@ wing one of the lines up .
they &apos;re surrounded by people , and their pas@@ sage through the room is im@@ pe@@ ded .
many other things that the l@@ h@@ c could discover .
absolutely remarkable .
another a@@ ha ! moment came from a 2010 wa@@ y@@ ne state university research project that looked into pre-@@ 195@@ 0s baseball cards of major lea@@ gue players .
please , don &apos;t try this at home .
when we painted the first building , by sp@@ las@@ hing a radi@@ ant orange on the som@@ ber gray of a fac@@ ade , something uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able happened .
people started to drop less li@@ tter in the streets , for example , started to pay ta@@ xes , started to feel something they had for@@ gotten , and beauty was acting as a guar@@ d@@ s@@ man where m@@ uni@@ ci@@ pal police , or the state itself , were missing .
we could change the invisible c@@ ler@@ ks within the ki@@ o@@ s@@ ks , every week , but we could not change this cor@@ rupt practice .
it is about how people think , how they view the world around them , how they use their time and their energy .
but haiti provided us with something else un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented .
but does it work ?
they &apos;re showing us what can be done with mobile , digital technologies .
and conver@@ t it to human@@ itarian good .
i &apos;m a no@@ ve@@ list , and i &apos;m interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common .
we need time &apos;s ar@@ row to understand cause and effect , not just in the material world , but in our own inten@@ tions and our mo@@ ti@@ vations .
and ther@@ ein lies its greatest conveni@@ ence and hor@@ ror .
it cannot be stor@@ ed .
my search is always to find ways to chron@@ ic@@ le , to share and to docum@@ ent stories about people , just everyday people .
and then we went to a fish restaurant , and we had ch@@ ad , the sur@@ fer du@@ de , ser@@ ving us , and he came up and my mother said , &quot; do you have any speci@@ als , young man ? &quot;
and she told this woman .
which sort of made me feel good , because he &apos;d seen a lot of things .
i &apos;m sure he thought i &apos;d take a book or a shirt , but i found an in@@ fl@@ at@@ able sheep .
the ig@@ bo used to say that they built their own go@@ ds .
chris ab@@ an@@ i tells stories of people : people standing up to soldiers . people being com@@ passionate . people being human and rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing their humanity . it &apos;s &quot; u@@ bun@@ tu , &quot; he says : the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me .
so almost all life on earth is wi@@ ped out about five times .
well s@@ van@@ te pa@@ ab@@ o has the answer .
why would that matter ?
and what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part .
well let &apos;s take a look at something like autism inci@@ dence per thousand .
other people react with various psychological conditions or re@@ actions to this information .
so this weigh@@ s a little more than a tent@@ h of a pound .
so this should be clear in these videos .
and that four-@@ dimensional space consi@@ sts of x , y , z and then the y@@ a@@ w angle .
and so here we looked to nature .
and to fly through obstac@@ les they can adapt the forma@@ tions on the fly .
so i want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by frank s@@ hen and professor na@@ than michael that shows this robot enter@@ ing a building for the very first time and creating this map on the fly .
in his lab at pen@@ n , vi@@ jay ku@@ mar and his team build flying quad@@ ro@@ tors , small , agi@@ le robots that s@@ warm , sense each other , and form ad ho@@ c teams -- for construction , sur@@ ve@@ ying dis@@ ast@@ ers and far more .
so we know flowers , we know fru@@ its and vege@@ tables , even some al@@ fal@@ f@@ a in ha@@ y that the live@@ stock for the me@@ ats that we eat , rely on pol@@ lin@@ ators , but you &apos;ve got male and female parts to a plant here , and basically pol@@ lin@@ ators are attra@@ cted to plants for their ne@@ ct@@ ar , and in the process , a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen , or that male kind of sper@@ m counter@@ part , along the way , and then travel to different flowers , and eventually an apple , in this case , will be produced .
why are bees doing better in the city ?
i &apos;m not one of the many researchers around the world who &apos;s looking at the effects of pesti@@ ci@@ des or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees .
i mean , lo@@ cally in boston , there is a terri@@ fic company called green city gro@@ wers , and they are going and pol@@ lin@@ ating their squ@@ ash cro@@ ps by hand with q@@ -@@ ti@@ ps , and if they miss that three day window , there &apos;s no fruit .
but i do want to talk to you about something that i think is de@@ ar to all of us .
why do we have this image ?
and that is a fe@@ at that we are not really conscious of that much .
whe@@ at is the most important cro@@ p -- the first cro@@ p we domesti@@ cated and the most important cro@@ p we still grow today .
let &apos;s go back to small@@ -@@ scale , to farmers &apos; markets , small bak@@ er@@ ies and all that . &quot; wonderful .
and i &apos;m making a real ple@@ a here .
there are also robots , for example , who can recognize wee@@ ds with a resolution of half an inch .
talk to farmers . when was the last time you went to a farm and talked to a farmer ?
i want you to think that every bi@@ te conne@@ cts you to the past and the future : to these anony@@ mous farmers , that first b@@ red the first whe@@ at var@@ ie@@ ties ; and to the farmers of today , who &apos;ve been making this . and you don &apos;t even know who they are .
how do you make a mountain bike for your arms that doesn &apos;t have the mountain bike cost and complexity ?
so we te@@ amed up with continu@@ um , a local product design firm here in boston to make the high-@@ end version , the developed world version , that we &apos;ll probably sell pri@@ mar@@ ily in the u.s. and europe , but to hig@@ her@@ -@@ income bu@@ yers .
and i know we &apos;ve all seen images enough to make us num@@ b , of the trage@@ dies that we &apos;re per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ating on the planet .
you can almost hear the dru@@ ms th@@ rob@@ bing back in that little cot@@ tage where we stay when we &apos;re there .
it &apos;s just a w@@ re@@ sting match , but a remarkable activity .
it has remarkable features .
people s@@ co@@ op water out of the cham@@ b@@ al and drink it , something you wouldn &apos;t do in most north indian ri@@ vers .
so , we &apos;re not sure where this story is going to end , whether it &apos;s got a happy or sad ending .
do you have those conversations with people ?
and so , really , so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on m@@ opp@@ ing up the floor without also turning off the fau@@ c@@ et .
this is not unusual , and it &apos;s part of what en@@ ables people to maintain these kinds of changes , because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life .
or they eat when they get depressed , or they use al@@ co@@ hol to num@@ b the pain , or they work too hard , or watch too much tv .
two-@@ thirds of adults are over@@ weight or ob@@ ese , and diabetes in kids and 30-@@ year-olds has increased 70 percent in the last 10 years . it &apos;s no joke : it &apos;s real .
and the fiber fil@@ ls you up before you get too many cal@@ ories , and it slo@@ ws the absor@@ ption so you don &apos;t get that ra@@ pid rise in blood sugar .
so when you go on these kinds of diet , they begin to smell bad .
it can be sexual inti@@ macy – i happen to think that heal@@ ing energy and ero@@ tic energy are just different forms of the same thing .
so i want to show you a clip of the film now .
we &apos;ve created a completely digital human head .
he needed to be a very sym@@ pa@@ thetic character .
and of course , the first step is : admit you &apos;ve got a problem .
that &apos;s not terri@@ bly comp@@ elling .
so , effectively , you get 3d data in real time of the subject .
so , in fact , anatom@@ ically , it is correct .
from there we went into a process called image analysis .
we also had to create an artic@@ ul@@ ating ton@@ gue that allowed him to en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate his words .
ed ul@@ br@@ ich , the digit@@ al-@@ effects gur@@ u from digital do@@ main , explains the o@@ sc@@ ar-@@ winning technology that allowed his team to digit@@ ally create the older ver@@ sions of bra@@ d pit@@ t &apos;s face for &quot; the curious case of benjamin button . &quot;
and they use a red hot iron need@@ le to make a hole through the mu@@ zz@@ le .
and this is what we turn them into .
the hy@@ ena is probably the most perfectly designed sc@@ a@@ ven@@ ging animal in the world .
and they started s@@ las@@ hing away at the back of the cam@@ els , and they started gal@@ lo@@ ping .
hello . this is kei@@ th bel@@ lows with the national geographic cam@@ el investi@@ gation unit .
you can &apos;t really see too clear . the fur &apos;s kind of grown over .
well -- and you &apos;re gla@@ d i didn &apos;t show you this .
ama@@ z@@ ingly full li@@ ps that allow me to eat prac@@ tically anything that grows .
no surprise .
attemp@@ ts to put my po@@ ems to music have had dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous results , in all cases .
one of my students came up after class , an intro@@ duc@@ tory class , and she said , &quot; you know , poetry is harder than writing , &quot; which i found both er@@ r@@ one@@ ous and profound .
no wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war .
the dead are always looking down on us , they say .
by the way , i lied about schu@@ bert doing the dis@@ hes , but that doesn &apos;t mean he never helped out around the house . &quot;
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
and of course , there &apos;s food on the box .
otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rop@@ e disappe@@ ars .
if you talk with a sad person , you &apos;re going to adop@@ t a sad expression and a sad post@@ ure , and before you know it you feel sad .
actually the way to study empathy in human children is to instru@@ ct a family member to act dist@@ ressed , and then they see what young children do .
so the one who makes the choices always gets a reward .
so that &apos;s the experiment we did .
and i think philosop@@ hers need to re@@ think their philosophy for a@@ while .
now , here come two more people , and immediately after , three more people .
and this was an amazing year .
i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical ad@@ vis@@ ers .
so that was nice .
and they esti@@ mated that 1.@@ 6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in europe because of noise pollution .
i do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make .
would i be willing to provide a scientific end@@ or@@ se@@ ment of a mo@@ o@@ d-@@ boo@@ sting bot@@ t@@ led water ?
so the first un@@ pro@@ ven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people &apos;s thoughts and emotions .
and in some cases , oxytocin can even decre@@ ase cooperation .
thank you .
we don &apos;t know .
and the pro@@ pon@@ ents of this theory point to that small pocket of dra@@ vi@@ di@@ an-@@ speaking people in the north , actually near afghanistan , and they say that perhaps , some@@ time in the past , dra@@ vi@@ dian languages were spoken all over india and that this suggests that the indu@@ s civilization is perhaps also dra@@ vi@@ dian .
okay . left to right ?
so imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard .
why is that the case ?
in dra@@ vi@@ dian languages , the word for fish is &quot; me@@ en &quot; which happens to sound just like the word for star .
space , we all know what it looks like .
the line carried the telephone signals that would later make bell a house@@ hold name .
jan@@ sky had made a histor@@ ic discovery , that cele@@ sti@@ al objects could e@@ mit radio waves as well as light waves .
thank you .
we do enjoy our mis@@ ery in a certain way .
but apparently , this is a strange paradox of life .
it should be done by fun . gener@@ osity is more fun . that &apos;s the key .
and you realize that this -- being with these people -- is the flower garden that ch@@ ih@@ o showed us .
he said , &quot; no , i want to abo@@ li@@ sh the poor . &quot;
150 years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people , children , had the right to education .
one of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persu@@ ade people around the world to change their behavior as well , so you need that global eth@@ ic of fair@@ ness and responsibility across the generations .
it said &quot; david , age 10 . &quot;
the trans@@ lation of that is , could you help me build a foot ?
if you want to study how a foot works , we &apos;re going to have to simu@@ late those surfaces , or simu@@ late that de@@ br@@ is .
it walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can &apos;t be seen .
robert full : it &apos;s spin@@ y , right ? it &apos;s really spin@@ y , isn &apos;t it ? it sort of hur@@ ts .
watch the leg come around , and you &apos;ll see it grab on right there .
and here &apos;s the simple version of a foot for a new robot that i &apos;ll show you in a bit .
they can run up a surface at a meter per second , take 30 steps in that one second -- you can hardly see them .
so we &apos;ve re@@ defined , now , what a foot is .
and so they were able to get this thing -- this is now sp@@ ed up 20 times -- can you imagine it trying to go up and rescu@@ e somebody at that upper floor ? ok ?
so the large bal@@ e@@ en whales will produce long , beautiful songs , which are used in re@@ productive adverti@@ se@@ ment for male and fe@@ males , both to find one another and to sele@@ ct a mate .
so when dolphins are separ@@ ating by less than 20 meters , less than half the time they need to use whist@@ les .
so it could have a negative impact on the whole population .
it had deep underwater micro@@ phones , or hydro@@ phones , cab@@ led to shore , all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole north atlantic .
that &apos;s shown down here .
it &apos;s lou@@ der than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers .
and i &apos;m happy to say that there are several very promis@@ ing develop@@ ments in this area , looking at the impact of shi@@ pping on whales .
but then they often wait there .
of course , we know today that galaxies ex@@ tend far beyond our own galaxy .
so , what you &apos;re seeing here is a wonderful presentation , but it &apos;s one of the t@@ ours .
what &apos;s the evidence of wi@@ ping out ?
and the problem is the industry is sup@@ pl@@ ying it .
again , i can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around .
i &apos;m a little more interested in the kind of creative applications we can do with this .
don &apos;t worry .
what if none of these things is the problem ?
so streets become more des@@ ol@@ ate and un@@ safe , so we stay home more -- which makes streets even more des@@ ol@@ ate and un@@ safe , and we stay home even more .
seven days later , eric was set free and was able to return home .
what are we going to do ?
and he had a real passion for golf , and he also created this whole myth@@ ology about ben ho@@ gan and various things .
ju@@ g@@ gling three balls is simple and normal .
it &apos;s being able to do something that other people can &apos;t do or can &apos;t understand .
you want to do it ? yeah ? ok .
so white ball and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . pink .
all right , i &apos;m going to get on my k@@ ne@@ es and do it .
to have a conversation with it . to speak . to listen .
the next piece that i &apos;m going to do -- which is the cy@@ lin@@ ders piece , if you want to get that up -- it has to do with cy@@ linder se@@ als from about 5,000 years ago , which were st@@ ones with designs that were used to roll over we@@ t clay with all sorts of great designs . i love cer@@ am@@ ics and all of that .
and to change , and to change .
and i think you &apos;re starting to see that , and it &apos;s making our job even more enjo@@ y@@ able .
so you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around , as you look .
s so far it &apos;s chaos , but a lot of people are doing stuff , so that &apos;s good .
you could have that kind of immer@@ sive experience of being underwater -- of feeling like you &apos;re underwater -- seeing what &apos;s going on .
well , it &apos;s always kind of funny when he comes up and ho@@ vers .
it &apos;s about an m@@ .@@ p@@ . called ge@@ off@@ re@@ y di@@ ck@@ ens .
isn &apos;t that incredible that we can &apos;t read each other &apos;s minds ?
the universe disappe@@ ars .
gas was invented in 1@@ 600 by a du@@ tch chem@@ ist called van hel@@ mon@@ t .
and that &apos;s what they do , radio . that &apos;s what they discovered .
je@@ an-@@ b@@ ap@@ ti@@ ste mi@@ chel : so how did we get to this conclusion ?
what we &apos;re left with is a collection of five million books , 500 billion words , a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome -- a text which , when written out , would stre@@ tch from here to the moon and back 10 times over -- a ver@@ itable sh@@ ard of our cultural genome .
alterna@@ tively , i could say , &quot; yesterday , i thri@@ ved . &quot;
people were walking around obsessed .
and this looks like the normal trajec@@ tory of a famous person .
it &apos;s kind of like genom@@ ics .
and it turns out that the less@@ -@@ frequ@@ ent &quot; ar@@ gh@@ s &quot; are , of course , the ones that cor@@ respond to things that are more fru@@ str@@ ating -- except , o@@ dd@@ ly , in the early 80s .
and then there is a whole range of fil@@ ters .
we &apos;re becoming im@@ patient .
where are they ? where are those ri@@ p@@ ples ?
if you &apos;re in any one of those ro@@ les -- and i think that probably is everybody who &apos;s listening to this talk -- the ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m is ras@@ a , which is the san@@ skr@@ it word for ju@@ ice or essen@@ ce .
and i would get har@@ as@@ sed sometimes .
and that night , her whole family took the cou@@ ches and she sle@@ pt together with her mom so that we could take their be@@ ds .
well , maybe it &apos;s for you .
but it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s not easy to ask .
what if we started asking , &quot; how do we let people pay for music ? &quot;
when i launched my wish last year , hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us .
do you know what it takes to do this ?
but maybe we should change the question .
but i don &apos;t remember exactly how it happened , but i have one re@@ collection , which was pretty strong in my mind .
i was very depressed . i said , but i can make a difference in this field .
and so the theor@@ ist guys say , well , i think this is what &apos;s going on , and the experiment@@ alist says , no , you &apos;re wrong .
but , you know what ? it &apos;s very , very regular .
and now it &apos;s not that hard , you know , here &apos;s the apple , here &apos;s the orange , you know , the earth goes around , that kind of stuff .
real intelligence is built on something else .
and it doesn &apos;t fit , so it gets all wr@@ in@@ k@@ ly . now look at how i &apos;ve drawn this here .
and these things happen all the time . you &apos;re making these predictions .
we test it by predi@@ ction . what is the next word in this , you know ?
you cannot learn or rec@@ all anything outside of a sequence .
i don &apos;t know how this is going to turn out .
we need to re@@ define what makes us secure in this world .
he said , &quot; you know that i kind of like medi@@ tation , and i pra@@ y . &quot;
and instead of going home , she con@@ fer@@ red with all the other women that she works with , who said to her , &quot; stay out . we need you out .
she also received the peace prize .
my mother carefully opened the door , and she lo@@ aded the laun@@ dry into the machine , like this .
because it remains hard work for women to wash .
and these ones who have wash@@ ing machines , but not a house full of other machines , they use two .
because the risk , the high probability of climate change is real .
and she also got books for herself .
we asked students who were walking by to participate in a study , and we took a shot with a web@@ c@@ am , and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop .
now you may be thinking , this does not apply to me , because i have nothing to hide .
transparency can be mis@@ direc@@ ted .
of course , these technologies imp@@ ly a shifting of cost and reven@@ ues between data hol@@ ders and data subjects , which is why , perhaps , you don &apos;t hear more about them .
al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o acqui@@ st@@ i : why priv@@ acy matters
we had a financial regul@@ atory regime based on the assu@@ mp@@ tions that tra@@ ders were rational creatures who wouldn &apos;t do anything stupid .
in one of my books , i joke that ben &amp; amp ; jer@@ ry &apos;s should make a paci@@ f@@ ist to@@ oth@@ pa@@ ste -- doesn &apos;t kill ger@@ ms , just asks them to leave .
and so one way to formu@@ late that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute , of which it can be consciously aware of about 40 .
we emerge out of relationships , and we are deeply inter@@ pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ated , one with another .
tw@@ enty percent of kids do not have those relationships .
the third is what you might call sym@@ pathy , the ability to work within groups .
and all at once i found myself saying as te@@ ars flo@@ wed , &apos; that &apos;s me . that &apos;s me . &apos; and those simple words brought back many thoughts that i had had before , about the fusion of our sou@@ ls into one hig@@ her@@ -@@ level enti@@ ty , about the fact that at the core of both our sou@@ ls lay our identical hop@@ es and dreams for our children , about the notion that those hop@@ es were not separate or distin@@ ct hop@@ es , but were just one hope , one clear thing that defined us both , that wel@@ ded us into a unit -- the kind of unit i had but di@@ m@@ ly imagined before being married and having children .
an@@ j@@ ali &apos;s father , a dr@@ un@@ k@@ ard , sold his child for por@@ no@@ graphy .
these people are dec@@ ei@@ ved , forced .
when i rescu@@ ed them , one of the biggest challenges i had was where do i begin .
my biggest challenge is society .
can you break your culture of silence ?
and those bits are words .
so , there &apos;s this guy , right ? vic@@ tor@@ ian era .
very useful word . so , look at that .
so , you can &apos;t get a smaller ham .
and so people say to me , &quot; how do i know if a word is real ? &quot;
one of them is just lab@@ eled &quot; mis@@ cell@@ an@@ e@@ ous technical senses . &quot;
he &apos;s found more than 1@@ 40 com@@ ets .
they use it sy@@ ne@@ c@@ do@@ ch@@ ically .
i think that i may have believed un@@ consciously , then , that i was kind of a business hero .
this has been a big , big transition time , and i believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever &apos;s next .
and so , gradu@@ ally over these three days , you start off kind of trying to figure out , &quot; why am i listening to all this ir@@ relevant stuff ? &quot;
they may well be by a ted speaker , and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual , emotional journey .
for some time now , it &apos;s been known that if you pay attention to the car@@ rier phase of the gps signal , and if you have an internet connection , then you can go from meter level to centi@@ meter level , even milli@@ me@@ ter-@@ level posi@@ tioning .
every time her ex@@ -@@ boy@@ friend would show up , at the most im@@ prob@@ able times and the most im@@ prob@@ able lo@@ cations , he was carrying an open laptop , and over time c@@ aro@@ l realized that he had plan@@ ted a gps tracking device on her car , so she was calling me for help to dis@@ able it .
they -- in fact , they don &apos;t up@@ date or up@@ keep ligh@@ thou@@ ses anymore , and lor@@ an , the only back@@ up to gps , was dis@@ continued last year .
here &apos;s ra@@ mon — — looking for a little attention from dad that week .
but will you be able to res@@ ist the temp@@ tation to track your fellow man ?
and of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritu@@ alism , the way my un@@ cle likes it .
and on the left side , you &apos;ll see the process@@ ed video where the camera has made him invisible .
but he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to lift itself up on its own .
a classic example is james han@@ sen , a nasa cli@@ mat@@ ologist pushing for 350 parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
so when you add up the greenhouse g@@ ases in the lifetime of these various energy sources , nuclear is down there with wind and hy@@ dr@@ o , below solar and way below , obviously , all the fossil fuels .
typically , these things are put in the ground .
if we look at the del@@ a@@ ys , it takes between 10 and 19 years to put up a nuclear power plant from planning to operation .
actually , the footprint on the ground for wind is by far the small@@ est of any energy source in the world .
we want to match the h@@ our@@ -@@ by-@@ hour power supply .
pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fis@@ si@@ le material is , and we can move toward zero weapons left , once we know all that .
the propag@@ anda from the industry has been very , very strong .
the last person who was in fa@@ vor made the pre@@ mis@@ e that we don &apos;t have enough alternative renew@@ able resources .
and you can match that demand , h@@ our@@ -@@ by-@@ hour , for the whole year almost .
you know , it &apos;s the first time that we &apos;re going to have a chance to have planet@@ ary red@@ und@@ an@@ cy , a chance to , if you would , back up the bio@@ sphere .
and we knew nothing about going to space .
but how cheap could it get ? i want to give you the end point .
and of course , we had beautiful spac@@ es@@ hi@@ po@@ ne , which made those two fli@@ ghts and won the competition .
and then i truly believe , once a group is in orbit around the earth -- i know if they don &apos;t do it , i am -- we &apos;re going to stock@@ pile some fuel , make a be@@ eline for the moon and grab some real e@@ state .
that &apos;s our value pro@@ position in a prize .
would they surprise us ? would they intri@@ gue us ?
so that means that surfaces can inter@@ se@@ ct themselves , they can become im@@ possibly small .
a challenge to me was how we could express this new algorith@@ mic order in a colum@@ n .
unbe@@ know@@ nst to me at the time , because we had only seen the outside , the surfaces were continu@@ ing to fold themselves , to grow on the inside of the colum@@ n , which was quite a surprising discovery .
inspired by cell di@@ vision , michael h@@ ans@@ me@@ yer wri@@ tes algorithms that design ou@@ trage@@ ously fascinating shapes and forms with millions of fac@@ ets . no person could dra@@ ft them by hand , but they &apos;re buil@@ d@@ able -- and they could revolution@@ ize the way we think of architectural form .
well , what is it to make a ther@@ ape@@ u@@ tic , anyway ?
how do we go faster ?
franc@@ is coll@@ ins : so what would you like to say to researchers here in the audi@@ tor@@ ium and others listening to this ?
it just started last dec@@ ember , and this is one of its goals .
and third , and maybe most important , we need talent .
we know that moder@@ ni@@ zation is happening .
you might be surprised to know that most people in the gulf who are leading these cultural initi@@ a@@ tives happen to be women .
our mission is of cultural integration and indepen@@ dence .
girl : un@@ cle k@@ hal@@ ed . here , put on the head@@ scar@@ f .
i welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initi@@ a@@ tives and discus@@ sions .
so i was hi@@ ding in the shed , like that .
and then i encoura@@ ged the ants to come &apos; round by putting sugar and things like that .
and underneath the microscope there were sp@@ l@@ inter@@ s of glass .
and as i was doing it , what happened ?
there &apos;s not enough room for the two of them .
decided to make a paint@@ brush .
in america they say a period stop .
that one took me appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely six weeks .
so the eyes are probably about one mi@@ cr@@ on or something .
and the prophe@@ t , in one of his sa@@ y@@ ings , said , &quot; ad@@ or@@ n y@@ ourselves with the attribu@@ tes of god . &quot;
&quot; and , &quot; god says , &quot; my ser@@ v@@ ant continues to get near@@ er to me , by doing more of what i &apos;ve asked them to do &quot; -- extra credit , we might call it -- &quot; until i love him or love her .
the language diff@@ ers , but the obje@@ ctive is the same .
and this was the 196@@ 0s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after con@@ feder@@ ate war gener@@ als .
i have cancer .
my wife , as i said , she grew up outside of boston .
lin@@ da , my wife , jo@@ ked that it was like having six different marriage pro@@ pos@@ als .
&quot; so it &apos;s 10 years from now , &quot; i said , &quot; and my daughters are about to take their first trip ab@@ road , and i &apos;m not here .
and one night i had a night@@ m@@ are that i was walking through my house , sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else &apos;s children sitting on my desk .
one day , my daughter ty@@ bee , ty@@ bee came to me , and she said , &quot; i have so much love for you in my body , da@@ d@@ dy , i can &apos;t stop giving you hu@@ gs and k@@ is@@ ses .
and he said , &quot; a belief in themselves . &quot;
and i just love this o@@ de to slow moving .
and all the collective minds in this room , i d@@ are say , can never find a solution for scan@@ -@@ x@@ iety .
now nan@@ ny &apos;s great other insight was to think , perhaps we should get derek something to play , and sure enough , she dra@@ gged this little keyboard out of the lo@@ ft , never thinking really that anything much would come of it .
now then , by the age of 10 , derek really had taken the world by storm .
dp : this .
ao : well done .
dp : &quot; tiger ra@@ g . &quot;
this is affordable and can come home with you and , as such , it can sit on your kitchen counter -- it can &apos;t go in your dra@@ wers ; trust me , i found that out the hard way -- and make your kitchen counter into a mon@@ um@@ ent to design .
i just explained design .
and so , i want to give you a gre@@ eting , as from a chimpanze@@ e in the forests of tanz@@ ania -- ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh !
it was , fortunately , one adult male whom i &apos;d named david gre@@ y@@ be@@ ard -- and by the way , science at that time was telling me that i shouldn &apos;t name the chim@@ ps ; they should all have numbers ; that was more scientific .
they know mental as well as physical suffering .
were the people that we heard about yesterday , on the e@@ aster island , who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid ?
they were feeling des@@ pair , they were feeling , &quot; well , it doesn &apos;t matter what we do ; eat , drink and be mer@@ ry , for tomorrow we die .
it &apos;s going to depend which part , say , of america they &apos;re in .
how many more minutes ? two , one ?
and just after that a woman brought me this little bell , and i want to end on this note .
now this is necessary to dist@@ ingu@@ ish the self from the environment .
some architec@@ tures .
so it &apos;s acting , in a sense , like a living system trying to preser@@ ve itself .
proto@@ cell ab likes to dance around for a bit , while proto@@ cell b does the f@@ using , okay ?
these are very dirty little proto@@ cells , as a matter of fact .
because , really , what i &apos;m trying to do now is re@@ define what coun@@ ts as health .
but by taking your ta@@ d@@ pole out for a walk in the evening -- there &apos;s a few action shots -- your neighbors are likely to say , &quot; what are you doing ? &quot;
this was vo@@ d@@ ka and solution , gin and solution .
but if we did this in every single -- every fire hy@@ dr@@ ant we could re@@ define the emergency .
you put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building , it &apos;ll heat up , and you &apos;ll get passi@@ ve air@@ flow .
go down there and buy some of those health food bars , the ones you call bird food , and bring it here and sc@@ at@@ ter it around .
so there &apos;s business cards down there that &apos;ll give you contact details .
when my father and i started a company to 3d print human tissu@@ es and organs , some people ini@@ tially thought we were a little crazy .
it is also less pol@@ ari@@ zing for consumers and regul@@ ators .
and this lea@@ ther is 21 layers thick and quite op@@ a@@ que .
by 2050 , it will take 100 billion land animals to provide the world &apos;s population with meat , da@@ ir@@ y , eggs and lea@@ ther goods . main@@ taining this her@@ d will take a huge , potentially un@@ sustainable toll on the planet . what if there were a different way ? in this eye@@ -@@ opening talk , tissue engineering advo@@ cate and@@ r@@ as for@@ g@@ ac@@ s argu@@ es that bio@@ fabri@@ cating meat and lea@@ ther is a civili@@ zed way to move past killing animals for ham@@ bur@@ gers and hand@@ bags .
and we wanted to take advantage of moore &apos;s law with electronic controls and software , and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected .
but if you built the alas@@ kan pipel@@ ine today , that &apos;s half of what the alas@@ kan pipel@@ ine would cost .
i just want to ask one .
like , i remember one day i found my dad con@@ vul@@ sing , fo@@ aming at the mouth , o@@ d-@@ ing on the ba@@ th@@ room floor .
so i began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that i atten@@ ded , and i really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me .
and we did .
i was born on a farm , a farm that was more than 50 percent rain@@ forest &#91; still &#93; .
i lost my faith in our species .
and i went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to prepare a project for us , and we started . we started to plant , and this first year we lost a lot of trees , second year less , and slowly , slowly this dead land started to be born again .
coming the other day from atlanta , here , two days ago , i was flying over deser@@ ts that we made , we provo@@ ked with our own hands .
there are thousands of trees .
landscape ec@@ ology concern@@ s itself with how the stream and the me@@ a@@ dow and the forest and the cli@@ ffs make habit@@ ats for plants and animals .
and if i zoom in to lower manhattan you can see the extent of new york city as it was , right at the end of the american revolution .
we can calculate the aspect .
so , we would read in field gui@@ des , the standard field gui@@ des that maybe you have on your shel@@ ves , you know , what be@@ a@@ vers need is &quot; a slowly me@@ ander@@ ing stream with as@@ pen trees and al@@ ders and wil@@ lows , near the water . &quot; that &apos;s the best thing for a be@@ a@@ ver .
and the structure of this is what makes nature work , seen with all its parts .
we can see the fields that the native americans made .
when i &apos;m starting talks like this , i usually do a whole spiel about sustainability because a lot of people out there don &apos;t know what that is .
so , this is what the planet &apos;s going to look like in 20 years .
give you a little pe@@ ek into our edi@@ tor@@ ial not@@ e@@ book .
but once you also have people living in close pro@@ x@@ im@@ ity to each other , one of the things you can do is -- as information technologies develop -- you can start to have smart places .
but unfortunately , most of the people on the planet don &apos;t live in the c@@ ites we live in .
and those things lead to things like this .
we t@@ weak that a lot .
these are indian nurses learning how to use p@@ das to access datab@@ ases that have information that they don &apos;t have access to at home in a distant man@@ ner .
does anyone know what this is ?
and it &apos;s a copyright viol@@ ation .
this is like having a license to print money and a barrel of free ink .
it took them a while to formu@@ late plan b.
and because the biggest produ@@ cers of content on the internet are not google and y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , they &apos;re us , we &apos;re the people getting poli@@ ced .
sop@@ a is simply a re@@ version of co@@ ica , which was pur@@ posed last year , which did not pass .
then , i don &apos;t look it , but i was the indian national squ@@ ash cham@@ pi@@ on for three years .
i went to this village for the first time .
a traditional mid@@ wife is a professional .
so we built the first bar@@ e@@ foot college in 198@@ 6 .
45 kil@@ o@@ watts of pan@@ els on the roof .
this is what we teach in the night schools .
the atten@@ dance must not drop . &quot;
you use sign language .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
success story .
our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information .
it &apos;s four blue zin@@ c atoms bon@@ ding with one white hydrogen atom .
we hope that all of you will come to see the allo@@ sphere .
so , just give it a moment of thought .
we synthes@@ ize happiness , but we think happiness is a thing to be found .
harry s. lan@@ german u@@ tter@@ ed these words , and he &apos;s somebody you might have known but didn &apos;t , because in 194@@ 9 he read a little article in the paper about a ham@@ burger stand owned by these two brothers named mcdon@@ al@@ ds .
i want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and en@@ during as the kind of happiness you stum@@ ble upon when you get exactly what you were a@@ im@@ ing for .
ok ? they remember their childhood , but if you walk in and introduce yourself , and then leave the room , when you come back , they don &apos;t know who you are .
&quot; yeah , right &quot; is not the right response !
you &apos;re married to a guy and he pi@@ cks his nose ?
it &apos;s a very small increase , and it doesn &apos;t much matter whether they were in the rever@@ sible or ir@@ rever@@ sible condition .
we should have pre@@ fer@@ ences that lead us into one future over another .
we have a rock@@ et@@ ma@@ ver@@ i@@ ck@@ s@@ .com website with my photos if you want to learn more about this , participate , be a spec@@ tat@@ or .
why do they do it ? it &apos;s for things like this : gene from al@@ ab@@ ama drives out there with this rocket that he &apos;s built with x-ray sensors , video cameras , fe@@ sto@@ oned with electronics , and he succe@@ eds getting to 100,000 feet , leaving the atmosphere , seeing a thin blue line of space .
my pop , he &apos;s one of the old sou@@ ls , you know -- old cu@@ ban man from ca@@ ma@@ gu@@ ey .
and then there are stories that we whis@@ per into a sty@@ gi@@ an darkness .
&quot; ma &apos;@@ am , did you know that was a light you just ran ? &quot;
bli@@ ther@@ ing fu@@ cking idi@@ ots .
because now she &apos;s picked up the highway 2@@ 85 , the peri@@ meter around atlanta , which en@@ com@@ pas@@ ses now -- there &apos;s seven lan@@ es , she &apos;s on all of them , y &apos;@@ all .
so he &apos;s talking to her , and at some point she says , &quot; then , you know , it was it . that was it . it was done . &quot;
&quot; no , no , no . the only thing with him is , he &apos;s an idi@@ ot .
of course , her come@@ back is , &quot; when have i embarras@@ sed you ? &quot;
i got to look . you got to look .
i jump out next to her going , &quot; don &apos;t you move ! &quot;
and she says , &quot; par@@ don me , ma &apos;@@ am &quot; -- that &apos;s how we talk down there -- &quot; is that your mother ? &quot;
and i &apos;m really worried , because when people talk about cars -- which i know something about -- the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking , &quot; let &apos;s use fu@@ el-@@ efficient cars . &quot;
so , how is it that people went from the 12@@ ,000 miles a year to 500 miles ?
the average american sp@@ ends 19 percent of their income on their car , and there &apos;s a pressure for them to reduce that cost , yet they have no out@@ let today .
this is my big vision .
what are the incredible we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses ?
so , we can provide the lo@@ west@@ -@@ cost means of going wireless co@@ ast@@ -to-@@ coast , we can have resili@@ ent nation@@ wide communication systems , we have a new tool for creating effici@@ en@@ cies in all se@@ ctors .
we had close family , good friends , a quiet street .
i spoke to him on the phone at 10 : 30 p@@ .@@ m.
i said i wanted to tell you the awesome story , i wanted to share with you the three as of awesome , and i wanted to leave you with a clo@@ sing thought .
having a sense of awareness is just about embra@@ cing your inner three year-old .
if you notice , he &apos;s actually need@@ le@@ poin@@ ting his own face .
i didn &apos;t know what was meat , what was vege@@ t@@ arian .
you can go to a conc@@ ert and hear gu@@ it@@ ars jam@@ ming .
tour@@ ist : i &apos;ve been wanting to come down here since this happened .
d@@ r : well the truth of the matter is , post-@@ september 1@@ 1@@ th , i felt myself in the role origin@@ ally -- first of all as someone who lives in tri@@ bec@@ a and whose neighborhood was deva@@ st@@ ated , and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that i was in the role of for@@ cing 100 people who work with me about creating the places we had been creating .
i was actually asked to be a commit@@ tee chair on an a@@ ia commit@@ tee to re@@ build .
there was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience .
and atlan@@ tic@@ -@@ he@@ y@@ d@@ t , who &apos;s the largest sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding contra@@ ctor in the country , volunte@@ ered to do it at cost .
you were funding it yourself and with contribu@@ tions and this foundation .
so that , very much , is in the realm of things i &apos;ve been interested in before .
d@@ r : john kamen -- who &apos;s here , actually -- put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use .
so in the spirit of full dis@@ clo@@ sure , i brought some pictures to share .
how many gs ?
isn &apos;t it weird that my 4@@ 8@@ -year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car , from the dri@@ ve@@ way ? &quot;
just two weeks ago , a bill introduced by sen@@ ator ke@@ fal@@ as that would have required athle@@ tes , kids under 18 , to wear a hel@@ met when they &apos;re ri@@ ding their bike died in commit@@ tee .
so i was curious about why there was a dis@@ connect between the way our society percei@@ ves dood@@ ling and the way that the reality is .
and here &apos;s the truth : dood@@ ling is an incredibly powerful tool , and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-@@ learn .
because dood@@ ling is so univers@@ ally accessible and it is not inti@@ mi@@ dating as an art form , it can be le@@ ver@@ a@@ ged as a port@@ al through which we move people into higher levels of visual liter@@ acy .
prices for ar@@ v@@ s , the drugs needed to treat hiv , cost about 12@@ ,000 &#91; dollars &#93; per patient per year .
it isn &apos;t only the number of drugs that are pat@@ ented .
nelson is a member of the expert ad@@ vis@@ ory group of the medi@@ cin@@ es patent pool , and he told me not so long ago , &quot; ellen , we rely in kenya and in many other countries on the medi@@ cin@@ es patent pool to make sure that new medi@@ cin@@ es also become available to us , that new medi@@ cin@@ es , without del@@ ay , become available to us . &quot;
let me show you analysis a colleague of mine did looking on different football , world cu@@ ps , olymp@@ ic games around the world , looking on the comfort and analy@@ zing the comfort people have percei@@ ved at these different sport activities , and let me start with mexico .
if we just look on what happens , we see , temperature &apos;s too high .
this is not only useful for sta@@ dia . we can use that also in open-@@ air places and streets , and we &apos;ve been working on the city of the future in mas@@ dar , which is in the united e@@ mir@@ ates , ab@@ u d@@ hab@@ i .
even here in do@@ ha i found this little no@@ ok where you can get al@@ arm clo@@ cks and wat@@ ches fixed , and it &apos;s a lot of tiny little parts . it &apos;s not easy .
and we syste@@ matically field tested , because in the field testing we learned some important lessons , and we went through many i@@ ter@@ ations .
great . good news .
and the daughter was ex@@ hau@@ sted from car@@ ing for her mother .
so , if you look at this image , right away you might be able to see that there are clu@@ sters of ob@@ ese and non-@@ ob@@ ese people in the image .
but you adop@@ t that combination , and then you start ga@@ ining weight like them .
and we used a variety of techniques to do this .
maybe , in fact , emotions have a collective existence , not just an individual existence .
now , those people both have four friends , but a &apos;s friends all know each other , and b &apos;s friends do not .
now , what is the point of this ?
i think , in fact , that if we realized how valuable social networks are , we &apos;d spend a lot more time n@@ our@@ ishing them and susta@@ ining them , because i think social networks are fundamentally related to goo@@ dness .
it &apos;s hardly time to rest on our lau@@ rel@@ s .
how fru@@ strated are you right now ? -- so that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having in their da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day lives .
so how can this be ?
lau@@ ra car@@ sten@@ sen : older people are happier
and this is happening every day .
and instead of thro@@ wing it out , people would think that &apos;s a kru@@ mp move , that &apos;s a kru@@ mp move .
so let &apos;s look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain , and know that when you see these people &apos;s faces that these are not just images of the lak@@ ota ; they stand for all indi@@ gen@@ ous people .
it began carrying , among other things , a large number of h@@ unter@@ s who began the wh@@ oles@@ ale killing of buff@@ al@@ o , elimin@@ ating a source of food and clo@@ thing and shel@@ ter for the si@@ ou@@ x .
the american dream of individual land ow@@ ner@@ ship turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reser@@ vation until nothing was left .
1900 : the u.s. indian population reached its low point -- less than 25@@ 0,000 , compared to an esti@@ mated eight million in 14@@ 9@@ 2 .
they &apos;re killing themselves while we watch them die . &quot;
it &apos;s not your business what they do with them .
what &apos;s going on here ?
as a result , 2@@ 5,000 people a year go blind , hundreds of thousands lose lim@@ bs , every year , for something that &apos;s sol@@ vable .
should you increase , maintain or decre@@ ase the number of flu@@ ids ? &quot;
it &apos;s more complex than that .
that &apos;s all it is . ok ?
but the truth of the matter is , you look at that car , it doesn &apos;t look like a vol@@ vo , and it doesn &apos;t look like a hum@@ mer .
the car s@@ wer@@ ves to avoid it , and therefore doesn &apos;t get into an accident .
the need@@ le is particularly shar@@ p .
but you know what we do on the last mile ?
we work closely with companies that have oper@@ ational capacity , or non@@ prof@@ its that have oper@@ ational capacity .
and that sugar d@@ ough ?
you could do parallel and series circu@@ its for kids using this .
i would never have the money to actually pay for the inst@@ all@@ ment or pay for all the bil@@ l@@ boards or the production of these , so there &apos;s always a cli@@ ent attached to them .
after a week , we took the sten@@ c@@ ils and the leaves off , shi@@ pped the new@@ spr@@ ints to li@@ s@@ b@@ on to a very sun@@ ny spot , so on day one the bil@@ l@@ board said , &quot; compla@@ ining is sil@@ ly . either act or forget . &quot;
now , the shor@@ t@@ cut .
so we have an agre@@ ement .
yes ?
come to -- no , no , no , no .
yeah ?
so , jack of spa@@ des .
excellent .
this is a tough one , because here i must take advantage of -- i switch it with the five of clu@@ bs .
do the cameras see the cards now ?
and now and then , i get some extra sym@@ pathy points , right ?
ah , this is tough .
i look -- shake the cards , so i don &apos;t .
just ki@@ dding , warming up -- king of hearts .
lg : it &apos;s not here ? zo@@ e : it &apos;s not there .
mis@@ direction .
maybe you have this child at home .
and then i got a letter from this gentle@@ man .
actually , i hear a lot , &quot; my husband is ton@@ e-@@ dea@@ f . &quot;
if i &apos;d done this with my head you certainly would have thought it .
now , he gets to f-@@ shar@@ p , and finally he goes down to e , but it &apos;s the wrong ch@@ ord -- because the ch@@ ord he &apos;s looking for is this one , and instead he does ...
would you think of somebody who you ad@@ ore , who &apos;s no longer there ?
how would you talk ? how would you be ?
it &apos;s about how many sh@@ ining eyes i have around me .
but today , against my better jud@@ gment , against the advice of my own wife , i want to try to dust off some of those legal skills -- what &apos;s left of those legal skills .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to time you . how quickly you can solve this problem ? &quot;
and i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even close .
software can do it faster .
what happened ? as long as the task involved only mechanical skill bon@@ uses worked as they would be expected : the higher the pay , the better the performance .
it &apos;s an approach built much more around intrin@@ si@@ c motivation .
work on anything you want . &quot;
and i say , &quot; no@@ pe . i have proof . &quot;
we already know this . the science con@@ fir@@ ms what we know in our hearts .
it &apos;s sort of sur@@ fing on a magnetic field at the c@@ rest of a wave .
it &apos;s balan@@ cing on a sha@@ ft and a ball , right at the center of gravity , or just slightly above the center of gravity , which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weigh@@ ty .
and then , this is like projects that are harder to build .
it weigh@@ s about 20 tons .
i happen to have tri@@ ple@@ ts .
we have one for the non@@ profit sector and one for the rest of the economic world .
in the 1990s , my company created the long distance ai@@ d@@ s@@ ride bicycle jour@@ ne@@ ys and the 6@@ 0-@@ mi@@ le-@@ long breast cancer three-@@ day walks , and over the course of nine years , we had 18@@ 2,000 ordinary heroes participate , and they raised a total of 5@@ 8@@ 1 million dollars .
well , you put those five things together -- you can &apos;t use money to l@@ ure talent away from the for@@ -@@ profit sector , you can &apos;t adverti@@ se on anywhere near the scale the for@@ -@@ profit sector does for new customers , you can &apos;t take the kinds of risks in pur@@ suit of those customers that the for@@ -@@ profit sector takes , you don &apos;t have the same amount of time to find them as the for@@ -@@ profit sector , and you don &apos;t have a stock market with which to fund any of this , even if you could do it in the first place , and you &apos;ve just put the non@@ profit sector at an extreme dis@@ advantage to the for@@ -@@ profit sector on every level .
but it absolutely is , especially if it &apos;s being used for growth .
now which p@@ ie would we prefer , and which p@@ ie do we think people who are hungry would prefer ?
they are all , you know , warming up and doing stuff .
unlike , for example israel , where audi@@ ences c@@ ough all the time .
that &apos;s a reason to go out of home . yeah ?
so he says , &quot; if i &apos;m -- if i &apos;m responsible for moz@@ art , this is going to be the only story to be told .
so , no , he doesn &apos;t want that . that &apos;s a different kind of control .
there is a wonderful story about kar@@ a@@ j@@ an conduc@@ ting in london .
it &apos;s not a physical thing . it &apos;s in the players &apos; heads .
let &apos;s see the next video , please . see what happens here .
but you need to have process and content to create the meaning .
some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us .
already that &apos;s fallen to about 11 .
we have the magic por@@ ridge pot in the form of wal@@ mart and tes@@ co .
it &apos;s open source . it &apos;s something which everybody who &apos;s involved with it develop@@ s and pas@@ ses on as they work with it .
so basically , you have a group of people who are excited by the idea .
but actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively .
i &apos;ve been aston@@ ish@@ ingly lucky , we &apos;ve been aston@@ ish@@ ingly lucky .
answer is 26 percent .
the paper said , &quot; it &apos;s not really balan@@ ced .
it really is this young versus the old to some degree .
the amount of i@@ q in good numer@@ ic analysis , both inside google and microsoft and outside , with analy@@ sts and people of various opini@@ ons -- should they have spent on that ?
so we need these pieces .
i wanted to become a doctor like paul farmer or ri@@ ck ho@@ des , these kind of fe@@ ar@@ less men who go into places like haiti or ethiopia and work with aids patients with multi@@ dru@@ g-@@ resi@@ stant tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ los@@ is , or with children with dis@@ figuring can@@ cers .
just as medicine ser@@ ves to he@@ al more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music tran@@ sc@@ ends the &quot; e &quot; in the middle of our belo@@ ved ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m .
however , here &apos;s chris &apos; clock .
now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
you see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignor@@ ed the other three senses .
j@@ in@@ so@@ p lee : design for all 5 senses
usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies .
take a look at this sentence : &quot; one morning , as gre@@ g@@ or sam@@ sa was wa@@ king up from an@@ xi@@ ous dreams , he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a mon@@ str@@ ous ver@@ min@@ ous bug . &quot;
learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend , or performing a ridiculous sk@@ it with friends looking like idi@@ ots -- things like that .
besi@@ des , if you continue to act like an artist as you get older , you &apos;ll increasingly feel pressure -- people will question your actions and ask you to act properly .
this is pic@@ as@@ so &apos;s .
this shows the artistic impul@@ ses inside us are supp@@ ressed , not gone .
i have another experience : in my writing class , i give students a special assign@@ ment .
they are de@@ vil@@ s . de@@ vil@@ s .
the great artist , then in her 90s , arrived at gi@@ mp@@ o airport and a reporter asked her a typical question : &quot; what do you have to do to become a great dan@@ cer ?
i was fortunate to join nasa and success@@ fully pro@@ pose an experiment to fly to ven@@ us .
i decided that i did not want them in the future to say , &quot; op@@ a understood what was happening , but he didn &apos;t make it clear . &quot;
that may not sound like much , but when added up over the whole world , it &apos;s enormous .
the physics does not change .
so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe texas and mos@@ cow he@@ at@@ waves were not natural ; they were caused by global warming .
if we had started in 2005 , it would have required emis@@ sion re@@ duc@@ tions of three percent per year to re@@ store planet@@ ary energy balance and stabili@@ ze climate this century .
in the old days of the silent movies -- har@@ old l@@ lo@@ y@@ d here , hanging fam@@ ously from the clock hands -- a lot of these guys did their own stun@@ ts . they were quite remarkable .
it &apos;s a frighten@@ ing piece of equipment for the no@@ vice st@@ unt perfor@@ mer , because it will break your legs very , very quickly if you land on it wrong .
we can flip lor@@ ries , co@@ ach@@ es , bus@@ es , anything over with a ni@@ tro@@ gen can@@ n@@ on with enough power .
what &apos;s interesting is we still use car@@ d@@ board boxes .
and i &apos;d just like to show you a little footage of what he did back then .
this is him in his old rock@@ -@@ and-@@ roll je@@ ans there , pushing him in , those turned up je@@ ans .
it &apos;s a three si@@ ded box , basically .
and then if the cab@@ in depres@@ su@@ ri@@ zes while the aircraft is coming back down , in whatever emergency meas@@ ures , everyone is okay .
one is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the pres@@ ent@@ ations that we &apos;ve had and in all of the people here . just the variety of it and the range of it . the second is that it &apos;s put us in a place where we have no idea what &apos;s going to happen , in terms of the future . no idea how this may play out .
and the girl said , &quot; i &apos;m drawing a picture of god . &quot;
and we run our companies like this , by the way .
every one . doesn &apos;t matter where you go .
if you want real evidence of out@@ -@@ of-@@ body experiences , by the way , get yourself along to a res@@ identi@@ al conference of senior acade@@ mi@@ cs , and pop into the disco@@ the@@ que on the final night .
we know three things about intelligence .
people weren &apos;t aware they could have that .
sir ken ro@@ bin@@ son makes an enter@@ taining and pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly moving case for creating an education system that nur@@ tures creativity .
now , as with any new idea , it wasn &apos;t easy .
i &apos;d say , watch any successful well-@@ written , famil@@ y-@@ friendly si@@ t@@ com in the west for your answers .
sa@@ dly , this leads me to another three bs that represents how the media in the west talks about us as bom@@ bers , billi@@ on@@ air@@ es and bel@@ ly dan@@ cers .
heart disease used to be the biggest killer , particularly for men in their 4@@ 0s .
why are they number one here ?
it depends , of course , on what scale or what scop@@ e you want to think about , but this is an organ of sur@@ real complexity , and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it , whether you &apos;re thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synap@@ ses that make up all the connections .
if we wa@@ ited until the heart attack , we would be sacrifi@@ cing 1.@@ 1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease .
we played with the children , and came back home really tired , ex@@ hau@@ sted , but with images of bright faces , t@@ win@@ kl@@ ing eyes , and went to sleep .
our dream is very simple : to send each of these kids , get them prepared to be educated but also to live peac@@ efully , cont@@ ented in this confli@@ c@@ t-@@ ri@@ dden cha@@ otic glob@@ alized world .
there is also this my@@ th that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school ; they &apos;d much rather put them to work .
vo@@ cational skill program for the older si@@ bl@@ ings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school .
there is an inter@@ -@@ school athle@@ tic competition that is held every year in bang@@ al@@ ore , where 5,000 children participate from 1@@ 40 best schools in the city .
and if you ask him what he likes to do he will say , &quot; i like sle@@ eping .
as far as i know , psychop@@ hy@@ si@@ cs is about measuring things .
and suddenly , like a bol@@ t of ligh@@ t@@ ning , the answer came to him .
that &apos;s called &quot; ad@@ her@@ ence . &quot;
and that &apos;s when you started to get seven different kinds of v@@ ine@@ gar , and 14 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ d , and 7@@ 1 different kinds of o@@ live oil -- and then eventually even ra@@ g@@ u hi@@ red howard , and howard did the exact same thing for ra@@ g@@ u that he did for pre@@ go .
what were they obsessed with in the early &apos; 80s ? they were obsessed with mu@@ star@@ d .
what do i mean by that ?
i guess my cancer different from your cancer .
one of my favor@@ ites is called sub@@ clinical ac@@ ne .
but i have some good news for you , because i &apos;m a journalist , i like to end things in a happy way or a for@@ war@@ d-@@ thinking way .
and it actually took being a journalist to understand all these incentives . you know , economists like to say , there are no bad people , there are just bad incentives .
but dad got really scared : he didn &apos;t want us doing that .
i tend to like science , where what we see and can as@@ certain are the foundation of what we know .
another one which belie@@ ves in the pure transparency of content .
comics pres@@ ents a kind of tem@@ po@@ ral map .
ad@@ jac@@ ent spaces were no longer ad@@ jac@@ ent moments , so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again .
we &apos;ll go by this a little quickly -- you get the idea .
but not so with m@@ á@@ r@@ que@@ z who once pra@@ is@@ ed his transl@@ ator &apos;s ver@@ sions as being better than his own , which is an astonishing compli@@ ment .
which in my experience means communication that man@@ ages to speak to and expand our concept of self-@@ interest .
and just like that , you &apos;ve been se@@ duced into a different way of looking at something because the end@@ or@@ ph@@ ins have brought down your defen@@ ses .
and this isn &apos;t some new phenomenon of our wired world .
and this cartoon hit the bu@@ ll &apos;s eye .
and the professional , historical lingu@@ ists in the u.s.
about 100 gra@@ ms of jell@@ yfish equ@@ als four cal@@ ories .
they look -- maybe they look kind of pre@@ histor@@ ic and un@@ finished , ab@@ ri@@ d@@ ged perhaps , but in fact , in fact they are the -- they v@@ ie for the top position of the most evolution@@ ar@@ il@@ y-@@ deri@@ ved fish in the sea , right up there with flat fish .
how do you get insight ?
and you know , the lo@@ cals think it &apos;s terrible behavior , it &apos;s just horrible watching this happen , day after day .
and we found that they kind of are home@@ bodies .
and to me that -- i don &apos;t think i could say it any better than the im@@ mor@@ tal b@@ ard himself : &quot; one touch of nature makes the whole world k@@ in . &quot;
these blocks represent le@@ ds .
us@@ man , the official story is that you learned to play the gu@@ it@@ ar by watching j@@ im@@ my page on youtube .
in@@ dr@@ a saw the woman , a se@@ k@@ hr@@ i .
there is a certain pattern in who gets char@@ ged with cri@@ mes .
and she created a dance piece which then prime minister ne@@ hr@@ u saw .
because there is no profit in it .
i think it &apos;s safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the es@@ cal@@ ating violence in our daily lives .
you &apos;re v-@@ i-@@ o-@@ l-@@ e-@@ n-@@ t .
and to say all these years of trying to make a better world , and we have failed .
i have an idea . i am going to go to each of these young men and i am going to ask them if they defe@@ ated correc@@ tly .
so , he wasn &apos;t only thinking about them ; he built one . this is the machine he built .
so it opens up a whole new world , and these people saw it .
they were using vac@@ uum tu@@ bes , very nar@@ row , slo@@ pp@@ y techniques to get actually bin@@ ary behavior out of these radio vac@@ uum tu@@ bes .
so , he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running , let alone having , you know , software problems .
&quot; picked a ligh@@ t@@ ning bug off the dr@@ um . &quot; &quot; running at two kil@@ o@@ cycles . &quot;
so it &apos;s almost exactly -- it &apos;s 50 years ago next tu@@ es@@ day , i guess .
it wasn &apos;t any sort of cre@@ ator intelligence , but the thing itself was a giant parallel compu@@ tation that would have some intelligence .
it took really three people : barri@@ cell@@ i had the concept of the code as a living thing ; von ne@@ um@@ ann saw how you could build the machines -- that now , last count , four million of these von ne@@ um@@ ann machines is built every 24 hours ; and juli@@ an bi@@ gel@@ o@@ w , who died 10 days ago -- this is john mar@@ ko@@ ff &apos;s ob@@ it@@ u@@ ary for him -- he was the important missing link , the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vac@@ uum tu@@ bes together and make it work .
we , the adults of the last four generations , have bl@@ essed our children with the dest@@ iny of a shor@@ ter lifes@@ pan than their own parents .
we need it . the time is now .
ju@@ stin here , 12 years old , he &apos;s 350 pounds .
let &apos;s start with the main street .
how are you feeling ?
there &apos;s a problem : if you &apos;re not a food expert , and you &apos;ve got ti@@ ght budgets and it &apos;s getting ti@@ ghter , then you can &apos;t be creative , you can &apos;t du@@ ck and dive and write different things around things .
jo : what do you think this is ? i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;ve got one kid , here , having , you know , eight tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of sugar a day .
i know , easier said than done .
absolutely .
it &apos;s incredibly important .
&quot; what do we do now ?
these were the various things that i was looking at as i was trying to understand it .
now car@@ der@@ planet was very interesting .
he sort of understood the technology , and he realized that security was very important if you were going to be a car@@ der , but he didn &apos;t spend his days and ni@@ ghts b@@ ent over a computer , eating pizza , drinking co@@ ke and that sort of thing .
born in mer@@ idi@@ an , i@@ da@@ h@@ o .
now i think we &apos;re missing a trick here , because i don &apos;t think people like ma@@ x vision should be in jail .
has about one-@@ third the carbon footprint of the average sub@@ urban d@@ w@@ eller , mostly because sub@@ urban@@ ites drive a lot more , and living in deta@@ ched buildings , you have that much more ex@@ teri@@ or surface to lea@@ k energy out of .
we all tend to think of sub@@ ur@@ bia as this very famil@@ y-@@ focused place , but that &apos;s really not the case anymore .
we also found a lot of examples of dead big@@ -@@ box stores that have been conver@@ ted into all sorts of commun@@ it@@ y-@@ ser@@ ving uses as well -- lots of schools , lots of chur@@ ches and lots of libr@@ aries like this one .
today , the trans@@ it , the main street and the new housing have all been built .
here &apos;s what the new main street looks like .
and the wa@@ vy line is a path al@@ ong@@ side a cre@@ ek that has now been day@@ li@@ t .
they have urban stre@@ et@@ scap@@ es , but sub@@ urban parking rati@@ os .
women go days , weeks , months , without looking at it .
in west@@ che@@ ster they call it a &quot; po@@ o@@ ky , &quot; in new jer@@ sey a &quot; tw@@ at . &quot;
and i started this piece , particularly with stories and narra@@ tives , and i was talking to one woman and that led to another woman and that led to another woman , and then i wrote those stories down and i put them out in front of other people .
it has taken me to universi@@ ties all over this country where girls are dat@@ e-@@ ra@@ ped and dru@@ gged .
she was 21 years old . i went to gu@@ atem@@ ala and she had sold out the national theater of gu@@ atem@@ ala .
and always as a child i had this fan@@ t@@ asy that somebody would come and rescu@@ e me .
so , how do i explain this mysteri@@ ous aff@@ in@@ ity ?
mr. tes@@ z@@ ler went down to the plant and con@@ fron@@ ted the th@@ ie@@ f and said , &quot; but why do you ste@@ al from me ? if you need money you have only to ask . &quot;
now , you should know that at that time , the tex@@ tile industry in the south was not@@ ori@@ ously se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated .
but it was music that was his greatest passion , especially opera .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said . &quot; that is what the lou@@ v@@ re said .
&quot; e@@ z a m@@ i m@@ un@@ kan@@ k ; es ne@@ m is kev@@ es . yo na@@ pot , pac@@ ak ! &quot;
ta@@ pe@@ stri@@ es were port@@ able . you could roll them up , send them ahead of you , and in the time it took to hang them up , you could transform a cold , dank inter@@ ior into a rich@@ ly color@@ ed setting .
and that , to me , today , is now the challenge and the fun of my job , suppor@@ ting the vision of my cur@@ ators , whether it &apos;s an exhibition of sam@@ u@@ ra@@ i s@@ words , early by@@ z@@ ant@@ ine arti@@ facts , ren@@ ais@@ s@@ ance portraits , or the show we heard mentioned earlier , the mc@@ queen show , with which we enjo@@ yed so much success last summer .
from there , you can walk in any direction to almost any culture .
that &apos;s the camp that we have in now 9@@ 0,000 people , where 75 percent of them are women and children .
because the last 20 years , the som@@ ali woman has stood up .
so dr. de@@ q@@ o has to explain .
when they come to me , they help me to treat the people , to help .
and my question is this : &quot; why are we ignor@@ ing the oceans ? &quot;
in fact , i have another version at my office and i ask people , &quot; why are there mountains here , on this area here , but there are none over here ? &quot; and they go , &quot; well , ge@@ e , i don &apos;t know , &quot; saying , &quot; is it a fra@@ c@@ ture zone ? is it a hot spot ? &quot;
this is on a mer@@ c@@ ator proje@@ ction .
that &apos;s why you get , you know , you get se@@ ash@@ ells up on mo@@ unt everest .
and when we cut them open , they didn &apos;t have the anatom@@ y of a cla@@ m .
all the way at the other end , in an al@@ kal@@ ine environment , at a ph of 11 , life existed .
because there &apos;s no oxygen there , it &apos;s the largest reser@@ vo@@ ir of hydrogen sul@@ fi@@ de on earth . shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ cks are perfectly preser@@ ved .
and within that , we &apos;re going to run it just like you run a nuclear sub@@ marine , blu@@ e-@@ gold team , swit@@ ching them off and on , running 24 hours a day .
and when you get a ja@@ w drop , you can in@@ form .
this makes education un@@ affordable for many people .
r@@ g : hanging cable takes on the form of a hyper@@ bo@@ lic cos@@ ine .
some students took their cer@@ tifi@@ cate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were en@@ roll@@ ed for actual college credit .
here , every single student has to engage with the material .
around each one of our cour@@ ses , a community of students had formed , a global community of people around a shared intellectual en@@ dea@@ vor .
but when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer , it &apos;s kind of hard to miss .
i think what he was compla@@ ining about is not universi@@ ties but rather the lec@@ tu@@ re-@@ based form@@ at that so many universi@@ ties spend so much time on .
thank you .
but only two percent don &apos;t know the effect that the de@@ bac@@ le in ar@@ gent@@ ina will have on the im@@ f &apos;s mon@@ et@@ ary policy -- seems a con@@ tradi@@ ction .
when we say &quot; i , &quot; -- as when r@@ ene des@@ car@@ tes said , &quot; i think therefore i am , &quot; -- we mean the head .
now we have to picture al@@ an green@@ sp@@ an in a black lea@@ ther cor@@ set , with a bu@@ tt tat@@ too that says , &quot; whi@@ p inf@@ lation now . &quot;
and i really learned this lesson during the sex sc@@ and@@ als of the clinton administration or , or as i call them , the good ol &apos; days .
i used to actually hang up on them .
it only takes two years to learn how to talk .
that accidents , that lou@@ is ka@@ hn , who talked about accidents , this is another quality of the trick@@ ster .
yes of course you got that . thank you very much .
you &apos;re into something that occu@@ pi@@ es space and in@@ hab@@ its time .
which leads me to a vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ e of a president bush press conference from a couple of weeks ago .
p@@ ills alone don &apos;t do it , especially in clin@@ ically depressed people .
we have got to develop the idea that the earth doesn &apos;t last forever , our sun doesn &apos;t last forever .
this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about .
and in my opinion , we don &apos;t spend enough time looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what &apos;s safe to do on earth .
so , there &apos;s a fairly simple solution to this .
there &apos;s no reason why we shouldn &apos;t start now .
you know , 10 years ago , or 15 years ago , really , you walk into an astronom@@ y conven@@ tion , and you say , &quot; you know , there &apos;s probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy , &quot; and they &apos;re going to ho@@ ot you off the stage .
it passed directly through earth &apos;s orbit . we were in that that spot six hours earlier .
we really need a dedicated obser@@ v@@ atory .
for a moment , what i need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination .
the system isn &apos;t ch@@ es@@ ape@@ a@@ ke bay .
now a layer in , the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting , par@@ tly as a function of temperature , par@@ tly as a function of all the other factors , and you &apos;ve got a really complicated system .
and many of you remember the early stages of oce@@ an@@ ograph@@ y , when we had to use what we had at our finger@@ ti@@ ps .
fiber : ne@@ x@@ t-@@ generation way of communic@@ ating .
and we &apos;re going to go down into the a@@ xi@@ al se@@ amount using animation .
it &apos;s smaller than a po@@ stage stam@@ p , and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move .
they sample the flu@@ ids coming out of the sea floor during an er@@ up@@ tion , which have the microbes that have never been to the surface of the planet before .
and yet , when i look at the environment outside , you see how resi@@ stant architecture is to change .
but architecture is that complete ec@@ st@@ asy that the future can be better .
it &apos;s not just a conservation in for@@ mal@@ de@@ hy@@ de of dead forms .
too many buildings that you see outside that are so ban@@ al tell you a story , but the story is very short , which says , &quot; we have no story to tell you . &quot;
of course that means that architecture is political .
you know frank ge@@ hr@@ y &apos;s buildings , they will continue to be unexpected in the future .
cri@@ tics like the performance to be repe@@ ated again and again the same way .
risks to create spaces that have never been can@@ ti@@ le@@ vered to that extent .
there is so many interests . there &apos;s money . there &apos;s political power .

in fact , we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack .
but whenever you &apos;ve got really new technology , it generally takes about three major ver@@ sions in order to make it a comp@@ elling mas@@ s-@@ market product .
the whole ecosystem is sol@@ ar-@@ powered .
i mean , how do you , the company , benefit ?
and so i tell people , well , i was trying to figure out the fa@@ stest way to turn a large fortune into a small one .

most people that are following the story of angel@@ ina j@@ ol@@ ie and bra@@ d pit@@ t will know where nam@@ i@@ bia is .
whenever we tried to h@@ unt , we were called po@@ ach@@ ers .
do you have anybody in your communities , or people , that know the bush very well and that know wild@@ life very well ?
and sometimes , once they were caught , they were treated with respect , brought back into the communities and they were made part of the bigger dreams .
they stay very much far away because this other thing has multipli@@ ed from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals .
i want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
do i do this three times a week ?
and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood wal@@ mart .
as a chef , i realize the easi@@ est thing for me to do is reduce the portion si@@ zes on my plate .

what do the computer models say about this , that and the other thing ?
it &apos;s a big under@@ taking . i stand here before you tonight as an am@@ bas@@ sad@@ or for my whole team .
it &apos;s been a re@@ mor@@ sel@@ ess , ste@@ ad@@ y increase .
now we turn on our time lap@@ se .
that &apos;s where it started .
or if you take an american reference , to the u.s. capit@@ ol building and you pack 3,000 capit@@ ol buildings into that block , it would be equivalent to how large that block was .
and for the last four years , my co@@ author phan@@ ish pur@@ an@@ am and i spent investi@@ g@@ ating this topic .
and specifically , there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of india .
what happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart , young , ambi@@ tious kids on a call center job ?
as many of you know , ibm has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies .
it is four in the morning . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t die on den@@ ch &apos;s birthday .
and how far down into it you figure we &apos;ll have to sc@@ roll to get to the golden ticket ?
and once we get involved in the ther@@ ape@@ u@@ tic decisions , again either personally or with our loved ones and family members , we also very quickly learn the benefits , the tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s and the limit@@ ations of these tools .
importantly , those special proteins are among the most highly char@@ ged objects in our body .
10 years ago , dr. pal@@ ti founded a company called no@@ vo@@ cure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients .
he received high dose radiation to the head .
by month 12 , we could argue whether there &apos;s a little bit of material around the ed@@ ges , but it &apos;s essentially completely gone .
there &apos;s research under@@ way now at harvard medical school to pick the opti@@ m@@ um pa@@ irs to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze that benefit .
but for the desert society this is no program ; this is their life .
it can also harv@@ est something like 2@@ 5,000 in a good mon@@ soon .
in many por@@ tions , water hy@@ ac@@ in@@ th covered these big can@@ als like anything .
or , if you want to paint , you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture colle@@ cts rain@@ water dro@@ ps and de@@ pos@@ it in the rooms .
but this is not ground water .
they say that a picture is worth a thousand words , so we can say a thousand words right now , an another thousand words .
these are the trees .
the battle against malaria is being won , with deaths from malaria down 27 percent , according to the latest world bank data .
ten percent &apos;s come from india .
they will get the tex@@ tiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industri@@ alization and wealth .
and the countries on the right hand side , you &apos;ll see the per capita gdp , basically every country with a per capita gdp of , say , less than 5,000 dollars , has got a corruption score of roughly , what &apos;s that , about three ?
ignore the scale on the bottom for a second .
no , not right now , just 30 seconds .
to put it very simply , the assu@@ mption so far has been that if you give people enough connec@@ tivity , if you give them enough devices , democracy will inevi@@ t@@ ably follow .
and police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek , which is &quot; el@@ u@@ de the cat &quot; in chinese s@@ lang , with other in@@ mates and hit his head against the wall , which was not an explanation which sat well with many chinese blog@@ gers .
and finally , the purpose of any auth@@ or@@ itarian deli@@ ber@@ ation efforts is usually to increase the legiti@@ macy of the regi@@ mes , both at home and ab@@ road .
so the way i tend to think of it is like a hierarch@@ y of cyber@@ -@@ needs in space , a total ri@@ p-@@ off from abraham mas@@ low .
da@@ d@@ dy &apos;s got you . that &apos;s all that &apos;s important .
the thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apo@@ logi@@ zing to me for crying in front of me , and at the same time , he was also giving me pro@@ ps , li@@ f@@ ting me up , for not crying .
he was having sex .
i go in his room . on his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named shei@@ la .
you see , we have to come to understand that less value , property and obje@@ c@@ ti@@ fication is the foundation and the violence can &apos;t happen without it .
is it the economy ? well , we have now the fif@@ th-@@ largest economy in the world in pur@@ ch@@ asing power par@@ ity terms .
but , what perhaps some of you don &apos;t realize is how far we &apos;ve come to get there .
and he whi@@ pped out his cell@@ phone , di@@ aled the number , and a voice said , &quot; i &apos;m up here . &quot;
one simple fact : you couldn &apos;t try to call an afgh@@ an at 8 : 30 in the evening .
it &apos;s a civili@@ za@@ tional story to begin with .
we &apos;ve got all of that .
and i sat , and i was like , &quot; man , i would buy that , e@@ h ? &quot;
after seeing that global impact , we nar@@ ro@@ wed it down to our key value pro@@ position , which was clean@@ lin@@ ess and conveni@@ ence .
so you can take a bacteria that really doesn &apos;t make these things at all , and if you could cl@@ amp these on it really well you have it taken off the street .
and they actually lived another 14 days , or 28 when we finally killed them , and took them apart and figured out what went wrong .
and , of course , we are am@@ used by jo@@ kes because they are funny .
what we see with , say , chocolate ca@@ ke is it &apos;s a super@@ normal stimul@@ us to t@@ weak our design wir@@ ing .
why are babies cute ? why is ca@@ ke sweet ? philosop@@ her dan den@@ nett has answers you wouldn &apos;t expect , as he shares evolution &apos;s counter@@ intuitive reas@@ oning on cute , sweet and sexy things .
but as they learn to become adults , they become much more sensitive to the opini@@ ons of others , and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarras@@ sed .
so if somebody can reach under the chair that &apos;s next to them , you &apos;ll find something ta@@ ped underneath it .
all right . i think i &apos;m going to take these off now , because i can &apos;t see a dam@@ n thing when i &apos;ve -- all right , ok .
of course they will . but they &apos;ll also ask , &quot; what can i do with it ? &quot;
no ? oh ! somebody did . fantastic .
now , actually , he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs , to see what the difference was in people &apos;s facility and speed with coming up with ideas .
now , while the e@@ am@@ es@@ es were exploring those possibilities , they were also exploring physical objects .
they don &apos;t necessarily even have to go into some kind of for@@ mal work@@ shop to do it .
because when children play a role , they actually follow social scrip@@ ts quite closely that they &apos;ve lear@@ nt from us as adults .
we &apos;re trying on these experiences .
i think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of -- i think what &apos;s very different about design is that we go through these two very distin@@ ctive mo@@ des of operation .
i can just sit back and rela@@ x . &quot;
and he put me on anti-@@ depres@@ san@@ ts .
richard st. john : success is a continu@@ ous journey
the most transforma@@ tive experience i &apos;ve ever had -- in that single moment , hearing dis@@ son@@ ance and harmon@@ y and people singing , people together , the shared vision .
now i should say , before that , what i did is i po@@ sted a conduc@@ tor track of myself conduc@@ ting .
thank you . thank you .
thank you .
i feel a clo@@ sen@@ ess to this cho@@ ir -- almost like a family .
and i &apos;d like to do that with a couple of examples of technologies where people have used game elements to get people to do things .
but the problem is , as f@@ ou@@ cau@@ lt points out , that every technology of the self has a technology of dom@@ ination as its flip side .
eth@@ ics was about the question of how to live life well .
because it pres@@ ents and materi@@ ali@@ zes a certain vision of the good life -- the good life in which teaching and learning and listening is about one person teaching , the others listening , in which it is about , learning is done while sitting , in which you learn for yourself , in which you &apos;re not supposed to change these rules because the cha@@ irs are fixed to the ground .
what does your chair say about what you value ? designer seba@@ stian deter@@ ding shows how our visi@@ ons of morality and what the good life is are refle@@ cted in the design of objects around us . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
we wanted to engage them , to have them gra@@ pp@@ le with ambi@@ gu@@ ity and guide them to synthes@@ ize the key ideas themselves .
more important is motivation and determin@@ ation .
and so today i &apos;ll talk about the extreme sto@@ ma@@ topo@@ d stri@@ ke , work that i &apos;ve done in collaboration with w@@ y@@ att kor@@ ff and ro@@ y cal@@ d@@ well .
and low light is a critical issue with fil@@ ming animals , because if it &apos;s too high , you fr@@ y them .
this was how man@@ tis shri@@ mp@@ s make these very fast stri@@ kes .
and what &apos;s shown here is a sa@@ dd@@ le-@@ shaped roof that he built that &apos;s 8@@ 7 and a half feet span@@ wise .
now , things -- i &apos;m making this sound very easy , this is actually a lot of work .
so really , just an amazing image , slo@@ wed down extremely , to extremely slow spee@@ ds .
so sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring .
now , you &apos;re not as thick as two short plan@@ ks , but you sound like it when you say &quot; earth , &quot; because that demonstration , if i turned around this way -- that earth plane would be as thin as paper .
you notice that jim camer@@ on is sitting in a seat .
and the craft that i &apos;m in -- this hasn &apos;t been shown before .
now , there she goes , right over@@ head .
what comes next in 30 seconds ? i can &apos;t tell you .
here &apos;s a map of my city , new york city , showing in@@ un@@ dation in red .
and so the core idea here was to hit the res@@ et button and re@@ generate an ec@@ ology over time that was regener@@ ative and clean@@ ing and productive .
and finally , how much fun it would be to watch the flu@@ p@@ sy par@@ ade and che@@ er on the o@@ y@@ ster sp@@ ats as they go down to the reef .
and what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody , that was creating these diseases that would wi@@ pe through the city every three or four years .
he suspe@@ cted an out@@ break that concentr@@ ated would probably invol@@ ve a single point source .
it &apos;s a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life , the life that we &apos;re enjo@@ ying here today . thank you very much .
so i was in d@@ har@@ am@@ sal@@ a meeting these people , and i &apos;d spent about five weeks there , and i was hearing these similar stories of these refuge@@ es that had po@@ u@@ red out of ti@@ bet into d@@ har@@ am@@ sal@@ a .
and the young people , young ti@@ bet@@ ans , are starting to say , listen , this doesn &apos;t work .
and i was -- i usually travel alone when i do my work , but i did this -- i ho@@ sted a program for discovery , and when i went down with the team , i was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people , especially into the hu@@ a@@ oran@@ i , deep into the hu@@ a@@ oran@@ i tri@@ be .
and this is -- i see this rolling out all over -- this is our site in oll@@ an@@ ta@@ y@@ tam@@ bo , per@@ u , four years ago , where they first saw their first computers ; now they have computers in their class@@ rooms .
this is an old may@@ an fun@@ er@@ al ch@@ ant that he got from his grandfather .
it &apos;s a very large number of galaxies .
there &apos;s the galaxy in the middle , which is the mil@@ ky way , and around that are the hu@@ b@@ ble -- you know , near@@ by kind of galaxies , and there &apos;s a sphere that marks the different times .
so let me show you some of nature &apos;s patterns that are the result of this .
and you &apos;ll see , first , the structure of the survey , and then you &apos;ll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there .
and when a number of fil@@ am@@ ents come together in a k@@ not , that makes a super@@ clu@@ ster of galaxies .
and we &apos;re going to fly around , and we &apos;ll fly around , and you &apos;ll see occasi@@ onally a couple of fil@@ am@@ ents inter@@ se@@ ct , and you get a large clu@@ ster of galaxies .
so there it is .
so that &apos;s where we are today , and that &apos;s what i wanted to give you a fla@@ vor of .
so i was about 11 when i went along to my first medi@@ tation class .
at the same time , this sort of constant mind-@@ wander@@ ing is also a direct cause of un@@ happiness .
you know , this is crazy . we do this all the time , even on an everyday level .
so to com@@ pen@@ sa@@ te , i &apos;d hold the pen ti@@ ghter , and this pro@@ gressi@@ vely made the shake worse , so i &apos;d hold the pen ti@@ ghter still .
but as i search@@ ed around in the darkness , i realized i was actually paraly@@ zed by all of the choices that i never had before .
so the end image was never visible as a physical whole .
in art school , phi@@ l han@@ sen developed an un@@ ru@@ ly tre@@ mor in his hand that kept him from creating the poin@@ ti@@ lli@@ st dra@@ wings he loved . han@@ sen was deva@@ st@@ ated , floating without a sense of purpose . until a neuro@@ log@@ ist made a simple sugge@@ stion : embrace this limit@@ ation ... and tran@@ sc@@ end it .
many were bu@@ ll@@ do@@ zed under at the time of the accident , but a few are left like this , kind of silent v@@ esti@@ ges to the tragedy .
green@@ peace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands .
her text said , &quot; mom , you will rock . &quot;
so just to take some quick examples : people text or do email during corporate board meetings .
i &apos;m the one who doesn &apos;t want to be inter@@ rup@@ ted .
over and over i hear , &quot; i would rather text than talk . &quot;
but when i ste@@ pped back , i felt myself at the cold , hard center of a perfect storm .
so before it was : i have a feeling , i want to make a call .
there &apos;s plenty of time for us to re@@ consider how we use it , how we build it .
we spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pu@@ b with friends .
never try to be better than someone else , always learn from others . never ce@@ ase trying to be the best you can be -- that &apos;s under your control .
and there a buil@@ der . up@@ ward rise the ar@@ ch of a church he buil@@ ds , wher@@ ein that minister may speak the word of god and lead a stum@@ bling soul to touch the chr@@ ist .
the yo@@ ung@@ sters didn &apos;t have to feel that we were going to keep them over .
and we forget there is no progress without change .
don &apos;t wh@@ ine . don &apos;t compla@@ in . don &apos;t make exc@@ uses .
i &apos;d want one to realize that defense usually w@@ ins cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ships , and would work hard on defense .
with profound simplicity , co@@ ach john woo@@ den re@@ defin@@ es success and ur@@ ges us all to pur@@ sue the best in ourselves . in this inspiring talk he shares the advice he gave his players at u@@ cl@@ a , quot@@ es poetry and remem@@ bers his father &apos;s wisdom .
over the last 20 years , we &apos;ve basically tac@@ kl@@ ed that .
or if we &apos;re going to use larger structures to replace larger structures , we can then use the patient &apos;s own cells , or some cell population , and the bio@@ materials , the sc@@ aff@@ olds , together .
another technology that we &apos;ve used is actually that of printing .
so we go layer by layer through the organ , analy@@ zing each layer as we go through the organ , and we then are able to send that information , as you see here , through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient .
i couldn &apos;t go out and play bas@@ ket@@ ball at rec@@ ess without feeling like i was going to pass out when i got back inside .
all i wanted to do was to get better , and i didn &apos;t realize how amazing it really was until now that i &apos;m older and i see the amazing things that he &apos;s doing .
so how easily could i swa@@ p our un@@ wanted copy of &quot; 24 &quot; for a wanted copy of &quot; sex and the city ? &quot;
over the next minute , you &apos;re going to see a bit like a concep@@ tual fire@@ works display of all the dots that went on in my head .
one , a rene@@ wed belief in the importance of community , and a very re@@ definition of what friend and neighbor really means .
that power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes in its entire lifetime .
i don &apos;t want the dv@@ d ; i want the movie it car@@ ries .
because i really believe it can dis@@ rupt out@@ d@@ ated mo@@ des of business , help us le@@ ap@@ frog over wa@@ ste@@ ful forms of hyper@@ -@@ consumption and teach us when enough really is enough .
and every time , they sent sc@@ ou@@ ts out there to make sure no one attac@@ ked them .
so last ju@@ ly ... i moved from america in june , ran in ju@@ ly election and won .
when we finally got out the back door , trans@@ form@@ ers were burning in the street .
co : yeah , but we don &apos;t even know what houses are accep@@ ting help at this point .
the other point is that it is hard .
and this is the curve for the d@@ all@@ as tor@@ na@@ does in april where we deplo@@ yed software .
imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place before a disaster .
and this is sul@@ tan@@ bel@@ y@@ i , which is one of the largest squ@@ at@@ ter communities in i@@ stan@@ bu@@ l .
this was sou@@ th@@ land , a small sh@@ an@@ ty community on the western side of nai@@ rob@@ i , kenya .
&apos;@@ it &apos;s a simple life , but nobody is restri@@ cting you .
this is the main dra@@ g of ro@@ cin@@ ha , the e@@ stra@@ da da ga@@ ve@@ a , and there &apos;s a bus route that runs through it , lots of people out on the street .
and when they have more money they cement their streets , and they put in se@@ wers and good water pi@@ pes , and stuff like that .
and there were three old ladies who lived in -- that &apos;s her self-@@ built house behind her -- and they &apos;ve lived there for 30 or 40 years , and they are the back@@ bone of the community there .
but let me tell you a bit about it today .
but i thank you here , lo@@ is , from this platform .
but , you know , i could pop a book on in the middle of the night , and -- now , the kurz@@ weil rea@@ der is simply a program on my laptop .
of course , talking books for the blind pre@@ d@@ ated all this technology .
the technology will adv@@ ance even further , but i can still remember my m@@ um saying , 60 years ago , &quot; remember , dar@@ ling , you &apos;ll never be able to read the print with your fingers . &quot;
it will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 .
bio@@ chem@@ ist gre@@ g@@ ory pe@@ t@@ sk@@ o makes a convin@@ cing argument that , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll see an epidemic of neuro@@ logical diseases , such as alzheimer &apos;s , as the world population ages . his solution : more research into the brain and its functions .
we are seeing an amazing fl@@ our@@ ishing taking place .
this is not the kind of socie@@ tal problem that i am concerned about .
the robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two , so the classic ec@@ on 10@@ 1 play@@ book is going to work just fine : encourage entreprene@@ ur@@ ship , double down on infrastructure , and make sure we &apos;re turning out people from our educational system with the appropriate skills .
we &apos;re not going to fix things for them by sending them back to mon@@ t@@ ess@@ or@@ i .
and most people , both within and outside the organized church , still have a picture of a cele@@ sti@@ al controll@@ er , a rule maker , a poli@@ ce@@ man in the sky who orders everything , and causes everything to happen .
it isn &apos;t a time for explanation , or pre@@ ach@@ ing , or the@@ ology ; it &apos;s a time for te@@ ars .
we have a pra@@ m service on tu@@ es@@ day mor@@ n@@ ings for mu@@ ms and their pre-@@ school children .
a god who looks after his own , so that chri@@ sti@@ ans are ok , while everyone else per@@ ish@@ es ?
early religious thought concei@@ ved god as a sort of super@@ human person , doing things all over the place .
in the end , we have to say , &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot;
tom honey : why would god create a tsunami ?
if we were to elimin@@ ate every single bit of technology in the world today -- and i mean everything , from bla@@ des to scra@@ pers to cl@@ oth -- we as a species would not live very long .
so , long before the industrial age we &apos;ve been affec@@ ting the planet on a global scale , with just a small amount of technology .
i call this entire thing -- us humans as our technology , everything that we &apos;ve made , g@@ ad@@ gets in our lives -- we call that the techni@@ um . that &apos;s this world .
that &apos;s where technology is going .
so , technology is sel@@ fish ; technology is gener@@ ous .
there are no bad technologies , just as there are no bad children .
so , i &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 8@@ 26 val@@ en@@ cia , and then i &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
and the idea was to put mc@@ swe@@ en@@ ey &apos;s -- mc@@ swe@@ en@@ ey &apos;s quar@@ ter@@ ly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other maga@@ zin@@ es -- we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
so we opened this place . and this is a v@@ at that we fill with treas@@ ures that students dig in .
you know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-@@ on-@@ one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
a bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world .
we &apos;re working on our college es@@ says . send them in . &quot;
now we &apos;re sort of addi@@ cted to the book thing .
it wasn &apos;t a non-@@ profit bu@@ ried , you know , on the 30@@ th floor of some building down@@ town . it was right in the neighborhood that it was ser@@ ving , and it was open all the time to the public .
so you can see the full effect !
this is l.a. , the ech@@ o park time travel mart : &quot; whenever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot;
you email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
this is my story .
we have only been discus@@ sing and consum@@ ed with high-@@ level pre@@ occu@@ pa@@ tions over tro@@ op levels , dra@@ w@@ down ti@@ mel@@ ines , sur@@ ges and sting operations , when we should be exam@@ ining the details of where the social fabric has been most tor@@ n , where the community has improvis@@ ed and survi@@ ved and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going .
we are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the mid@@ st of wars .
there is no way we can talk about the building of st@@ ability if we don &apos;t start invest@@ ing in women and girls .
i hum@@ bly add -- hum@@ bly add -- that out beyond the worlds of war and peace , there is a field , and there are many women and men &#91; who &#93; are meeting there .
i opened up a magazine , and vis@@ a &apos;s br@@ anding was , &quot; business takes simplicity . &quot;
i &apos;m at this place called the media lab .
and there was this person , mu@@ ri@@ el co@@ oper .
so , if you sort of compare that , like this , you &apos;ll see that computer versus human -- i &apos;ve been tracking this for the last year -- computer versus human over the last year has changed .
tomorrow , pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i is speaking . i love pa@@ ol@@ a .
in japan , it &apos;s a wonderful thing to remove the cle@@ ment@@ ine pe@@ el just in one piece . who &apos;s done that before ? one-@@ piece cle@@ ment@@ ine ?
the car is so big , the camera is so small , yet the man@@ ual for the camera is so much bigger than the car man@@ ual .
when you want less , it &apos;s because it &apos;s about work .
but if any of you people ask , &quot; what actually goes up ? does anything go up ?
and she said , &quot; you know , if you dy@@ ed your hair black , you would look just like al gore . &quot;
but the difference is , on earth , most of the carbon has been le@@ ech@@ ed over time out of the atmosphere , de@@ pos@@ ited in the ground as coal , oil , natural gas , etc . on ven@@ us , most of it is in the atmosphere . the difference is that our temperature is 5@@ 9 degrees on average . on ven@@ us , it &apos;s 8@@ 55 . this is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible , and putting it into the atmosphere .
but we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis . this is in bo@@ li@@ via -- over thir@@ ty years .
we can &apos;t wait for the kind of dr@@ ought australia had to change our political culture .
a@@ g : the answer to the question is hard for me because , on the one hand , i think that we should feel really great about the fact that the republi@@ can nom@@ ine@@ e -- certain nom@@ ine@@ e -- john mc@@ ca@@ in , and both of the fin@@ alists for the democratic nom@@ ination -- all three have a very different and for@@ war@@ d-@@ le@@ an@@ ing position on the climate crisis . all three have offered leadership , and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration . and i think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and pro@@ pos@@ als . but the campaign dialo@@ gue that -- as illu@@ strated by the questions -- that was put together by the lea@@ gue of conservation vot@@ ers , by the way , the analysis of all the questions -- and , by the way , the deb@@ ates have all been spon@@ sor@@ ed by something that goes by the or@@ wel@@ li@@ an lab@@ el , &quot; clean coal . &quot; has anybody noticed that ?
what &apos;s needed really is a higher level of consciousness .
he doesn &apos;t want to put high-@@ speed internet at home .
new sen@@ sing elements on the body -- you can grow ha@@ irs on your na@@ ils , and therefore grab some of the particles from another person .
so , we &apos;ll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything lea@@ ther in the future .
and same thing here , social tel@@ e-@@ presence .
also , the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses cap@@ abilities so that we can achieve more .
he &apos;s working for the exhibition on a whole series of doll@@ s that explain to children where babies come from today .
so what i started thinking was , perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .
why should there be order in war ?
can we create the kind of patterns that we &apos;re seeing in places like iraq ?
and it sta@@ ys there through the invasi@@ on of fall@@ u@@ ja@@ h until the sam@@ ar@@ ra bom@@ b@@ ings in the ira@@ q@@ i elections of &apos; 0@@ 6 .
this , in a way , is one of the challenges of how to interpre@@ t a really good idea .
and , of course , you can &apos;t do that unless you understand yourself a bit more .
what does this compassion ent@@ a@@ il ?
and as he was do@@ zing off , they were reading from the book of levi@@ tic@@ us in the tor@@ ah .
every week , the cle@@ aner would come . &quot; god you &apos;ve answer@@ ed my ple@@ a again . &quot;
and it &apos;s from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning , that pain is a disease .
you can see that the arm is dis@@ color@@ ed , pur@@ pli@@ sh in color .
the nervous system has plasti@@ city .
the dinosaurs had a really bad day .
that would be bad .
but if it came over a city , an important city -- not that any city is more important than others , but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis -- that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization .
it &apos;s roughly 250 y@@ ards across , so it &apos;s pretty big -- big size , you know , bigger than a football stadium -- and it &apos;s going to pass by the earth in april of 20@@ 29 .
if we need , if we see an asteroid that &apos;s coming toward us , and it &apos;s headed right for us , and we have two years to go , boom ! we hit it .
but we &apos;d be rich !
seen from another point of view , it gives quite a different impres@@ sion .
once they thre@@ aten your ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ers , market forces are actually , you know , destroyed , and the ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ers do not want to come -- no matter how much does it make sense for them -- do not want to come and adverti@@ se .
actually , i under@@ esti@@ mated the at@@ ro@@ cities , i have to admit .
you see , at the level of a concept , it was a great concept .
and that &apos;s the best they could do .
the city was closed until early &apos; 90s because , of all things , they were producing glass for tu@@ po@@ le@@ v planes .
if you take the camera above , you start thinking about these numbers again .
but the point is , if we ever survive to actually issue them , find enough inve@@ stors that this can be considered a success , there &apos;s nothing stopp@@ ing the next organization to start to issue bon@@ ds next spring .
we &apos;ll be talking about them .
i &apos;ll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer , and that is , it has nothing to do with human beings .
you &apos;ve heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway .
cou@@ l@@ om@@ b , in france , found the same law for electric char@@ ges .
the last two , the first equation says that electric char@@ ges and curr@@ ents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields .
there &apos;s the story , which is not absolutely certain to be right , but a lot of people told it .
it doesn &apos;t di@@ min@@ ish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things , plus accidents .
but he read books in every sp@@ are moment he could find .
so fu@@ eled by that ambi@@ tion , he returned to the state legis@@ l@@ ature .
but as he was about to put his sig@@ nature on the pro@@ cla@@ mation his own hand was num@@ b and sha@@ king because he had sha@@ ken a thousand hands that morning at a new year &apos;s re@@ ception .
we had a big dance at the white house .
and he started out , &quot; dor@@ is , more than any other woman i have ever known ... &quot; and my heart s@@ ank .
the lawyers and the jud@@ ges would travel from one county cour@@ thou@@ se to the other , and when anyone was knowing lincoln was in town , they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories .
which took much of the dra@@ ma of this two-@@ hour telling away .
so he said , &quot; look , i &apos;ll tell you something .
and as you can see , it &apos;s been kno@@ cked about a bit , which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was du@@ g up in 18@@ 7@@ 9 .
they &apos;re not sh@@ y of hyper@@ bo@@ le as you can see .
the empire of iran , the me@@ des and the persi@@ ans , united under cy@@ rus , became the first great world empire .
after alexander , the other emp@@ ires , bab@@ yl@@ on dec@@ lines , falls into ru@@ ins , and all the tra@@ ces of the great baby@@ lon@@ ian empire are lost -- until 18@@ 7@@ 9 when the cy@@ linder is discovered by a british museum exhibition dig@@ ging in bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the debate un@@ sett@@ les everybody in the 19th century to realize that the he@@ bre@@ w scrip@@ tures are part of a much wider world of religion .
it becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all irani@@ ans -- muslims and non-@@ muslims , chri@@ sti@@ ans , z@@ or@@ o@@ a@@ stri@@ ans , je@@ ws living in iran , people who are de@@ v@@ out , not de@@ v@@ out .
it certainly says far more about real free@@ dom@@ s than mag@@ na car@@ ta .
they communicate their de@@ light to their children , who respond with s@@ miles , and a desire to achieve more and to learn more .
across all of these diverse lands and cultures , the institutions , and the child &apos;s journey through them , is depres@@ sing@@ ly similar .
many countries have developed national action plans for change .
maybe i can use the form of film con@@ struc@@ tively to in some way make a difference .
he saw the bomb go off at na@@ gas@@ ak@@ i .
for me , it was really about the process .
and working with ngos and building this case .
and obviously he never came down . the statement was never made .
we started moving around the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors of the u.n. system , governments and ngos , trying desper@@ ately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it , see if we could make it possible .
so these guys were absolutely cru@@ cial .
we went back to afghanistan , because the next year was coming , and we wanted to support .
and you can see the education box there .
he said , &quot; no , i &apos;d talk to the individuals . &quot;
and yet , one is a chim@@ p , and the other is a cow .
maybe the problem was with the basic assu@@ mption that all brains are made in the same way .
a brain that huge would be cr@@ us@@ hed by its own weight , and this impossible brain would go in the body of 8@@ 9 tons .
and what we found is that because neurons are so expensive , there is a tra@@ de@@ off between body size and number of neurons .
my answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cortex , and i think that &apos;s the simpl@@ est explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
and i became obsessed with this idea of bl@@ ur@@ ring the peri@@ meter of the body , so you couldn &apos;t see where the skin ended and the near environment started .
i work for the red cross and i &apos;m a physical therap@@ ist .
it &apos;s 21 years , but they are still all there .
why don &apos;t you have the artificial legs ? &quot;
i said , &quot; no .
we knew that many more patients could not come , pre@@ v@@ ented by the fighting .
you know , 50 meters can be a long distance if you are totally exposed , but we managed to reach the shel@@ ter .
now help me not to be a beg@@ gar anymore . &quot;
i said , &quot; listen , it &apos;s in@@ san@@ e .
and you know what ?
i have a wish , a big wish , that this way of working , this way of thinking , is going to be imple@@ mented in other countries .
like many of you here , i am trying to contribute towards a ren@@ ais@@ s@@ ance in africa .
start all over again .
i got lucky .
and it was brilliant to be part of this team .
i couldn &apos;t just stay in seattle and raise my kids in an up@@ per@@ -@@ middle class neighborhood and feel good about it .
that if we invol@@ ve them in their education , if we have them discuss the real issues that they con@@ front -- that our whole society con@@ fron@@ ts -- and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world , that magic will happen .
i am even more thri@@ ll@@ ed by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student government .
patri@@ ck a@@ wu@@ ah makes the case that a liberal arts education is critical to forming true leaders .
and we can measure this very , very precisely with ke@@ pl@@ er and tra@@ ce their effects .
and it makes a very bad micro@@ phone ; i &apos;ve tried it many times .
i &apos;m an actor who plays a specific part .
good b@@ ye . &quot;
and that &apos;s the kind of information they &apos;re going to bring back to you ?
he just doesn &apos;t care .
du@@ h .
the answer may surprise you .
i think that something needs to be done about this .
she did accept and then bac@@ ked away .
so when this machine breaks , the machines they have to work with break , they &apos;ve got to try and figure it out , but most of the time , that &apos;s the end of the road .
35 million sur@@ ger@@ ies are attemp@@ ted every year without safe anes@@ thes@@ ia .
the only difference is that now you &apos;re only working with 21 percent oxygen .
well we &apos;ve seen good results so far .
the idea , the dream , was really for a sort of bau@@ haus sort of school where new ideas were inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated and investi@@ g@@ ated , the creation of a new visual language based on the african creative her@@ it@@ age .
the va@@ i people of liber@@ ia had a long tradition of liter@@ acy before their first contact with europe@@ ans in the 18@@ 0@@ 0s .
and why do i say it ?
maybe a few lung diseases here and there , but , you know , that &apos;s not such a big deal .
either they &apos;re out@@ voted by pu@@ ppe@@ ts of agri@@ business , or they are pu@@ ppe@@ ts of agri@@ business .
everyone was a lo@@ ca@@ vor@@ e : even new york had pig far@@ ms near@@ by , and shi@@ pping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion .
in new york , an orange was a common christmas present , because it came all the way from florida .
now , someone had to eat all that stuff , so we got fast food .
the chicken is fed corn , and then its meat is ground up , and mix@@ ed with more corn products to add bul@@ k and bin@@ der , and then it &apos;s fri@@ ed in corn oil .
70 percent of the agricultural land on earth , 30 percent of the earth &apos;s land surface is directly or indi@@ rec@@ tly de@@ voted to raising the animals we &apos;ll eat .
less meat , less jun@@ k , more plants .
i realized that what i was being pit@@ ched was a bin@@ ary solution .
all right , so let &apos;s take four subjects that obviously go together : big data , tat@@ to@@ os , im@@ mortality and the gre@@ e@@ ks .
so lesson number one : s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us .
thank you .
suppose we appro@@ x@@ ima@@ ted one person with one book ?
everybody who has looked at this and studied it agre@@ es .
i think that &apos;s a big , big problem .
we have skin en@@ han@@ c@@ ements , clo@@ thing .
all of these would enable , in principle -- be am@@ enable to en@@ han@@ cement .
it &apos;s a part of the space that &apos;s accessible to animals ; since we are animals , we are a sub@@ set of that .
and i &apos;m wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces .
but then i started dre@@ aming of having six colors .
you &apos;ve got gravity , you &apos;ve got the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gal force , you &apos;ve got the fluid dynamics .
so i think , concei@@ v@@ ably , those could be predi@@ ctive .
and to interface with it , with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do , giving them pig@@ ment and paint just like an artist , it &apos;s a good ally .
about a year later , i get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of stu@@ ff@@ ed animals in the trash , and suddenly i have more to@@ ys than i &apos;ve ever had in my whole life .
tan@@ ia lun@@ a : how a pen@@ ny made me feel like a million@@ ai@@ re
so i started thinking and li@@ sting what all it was that i thought would make a perfect bien@@ ni@@ al .
and i &apos;m such a techni@@ cian , so i loved this project , getting to play with all the techniques .
the sun ris@@ es , and it mel@@ ts away .
and whatever he makes somehow refer@@ ences ne@@ sting and space and personal property .
and a dig j@@ ig -- a dig j@@ ig is where , for a mi@@ le@@ stone an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary or a birthday , you gather all your friends and family together and you dance on where you &apos;re going to be bu@@ ried .
the next artist is ha@@ z@@ el c@@ lau@@ sen .
next is g@@ inger ch@@ es@@ hire .
thank you . thanks .
this , too , is origami , and this shows where we &apos;ve gone in the modern world .
if we o@@ be@@ y these laws , we can do amazing things .
the last step is not so hard , but that middle step -- going from the abstract descri@@ ption to the fol@@ ded shape -- that &apos;s hard .
what do i need ? i need a lot of circles .
and you can do more than just insects .
it &apos;s an artist &apos;s ren@@ di@@ tion , but it flew in a japanese telescope in 199@@ 5 .
but this is a five-@@ meter telescope -- has about a quar@@ ter-@@ mile fo@@ cal length .
and as weird and surprising as it may sound , origami may some@@ day even save a life .
it &apos;s twice the range of any electric motor@@ cycle .
certainly this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had great progress with women .
they were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future .
what it &apos;s about is that the economy has changed a lot .
people have asked men , why don &apos;t they just go back to college , to community college , say , and re@@ tool themselves , learn a new set of skills ?
basically , the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day , that their husband would maybe have a job , but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the ki@@ d@@ dies .
over several decades , south korea built one of the most patri@@ arch@@ al societies we know about .
so for a long time in the economic sphere , we &apos;ve lived with the term &quot; glass cei@@ ling . &quot;
and i tried , as a child , as a teenager , to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that i could see as a possible answer to that question .
and he says by descri@@ bing it as an ec@@ static state .
and he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself .
i couldn &apos;t improve on this as a good example of how flow en@@ ters the work@@ place .
rela@@ x@@ ation is fine -- you still feel ok .
where do you see your doctor and your den@@ ti@@ st ? &quot;
because when my grand@@ parents were born , they pretty much had their sense of home , their sense of community , even their sense of en@@ mit@@ y , as@@ signed to them at birth , and didn &apos;t have much chance of ste@@ pping outside of that .
where you come from now is much less important than where you &apos;re going .
and at my feet was the great , still blue plate of the pacific ocean .
movement is a fantastic privilege , and it allows us to do so much that our grand@@ parents could never have dre@@ amed of doing .
so thank you very much .
a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the western population moved over to here .
and they will start to buy electric cars .
can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ?
this will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
now , we know about smo@@ king , deep@@ -@@ fri@@ ed mars bars , chips -- the glas@@ go@@ w diet .
it also di@@ l@@ ates the cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies , so it st@@ ops ang@@ ina .
and we then thought to ourselves , with those big stores , i wonder if sunlight might activ@@ ate those stores and release them from the skin , where the stores are about 10 times as big as what &apos;s in the circu@@ lation .
so what we &apos;ve next done is we &apos;ve moved on to looking at blood ves@@ sel di@@ lat@@ ation .
we think it probably accoun@@ ts for a lot of the nor@@ th-@@ south health divide within britain , it &apos;s of relev@@ ance to us .
medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive .
your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that &apos;s ready to take over at the time of in@@ jury . it happens every day .
what do we do when we have inju@@ ries for structures which are much larger than one centi@@ meter ?
you &apos;re going to place this in an o@@ ven@@ -like device .
we brought patients in , six to eight weeks pri@@ or to their sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed surgery , did x-@@ rays , and we then com@@ posed a sc@@ aff@@ old specifically for that patient &apos;s size pel@@ vic ca@@ vi@@ ty .
it &apos;s actually printing this two cham@@ ber heart , one layer at a time .
they are actually making ur@@ ine .
but it takes a lot to get there .
and that is really very simple , to make our patients better .
i think we have an ob@@ li@@ gation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish -- the old par@@ able : &quot; if you give a man a fish , you feed him for a day .
it &apos;s probably why i &apos;m a little bit pan@@ i@@ cked right now -- other than all the ca@@ ff@@ eine that i &apos;ve had and the sugar -- but this is really cre@@ ep@@ y for an entrepren@@ eur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to go to an m@@ ba program .
at seven years old i figured it out . i got three and a half cents for a thousand co@@ at han@@ gers .
so that &apos;s obvious , right .
and making money off that too .
mean@@ while , my friends were working for five hours to hau@@ l some guy &apos;s bag around and get paid 10 bucks .
this is what really kind of gets everybody hat@@ ing you is because you &apos;re trying to extract money from all your friends all the time .
and then you know what we do ? we negoti@@ ate .
when you see gr@@ um@@ py custom@@ er service , point that out to them .
but how about getting entreprene@@ ur@@ ship to be ran@@ ked right up there with the rest of them as well ?
expertise has for sure had its moments .
and that was only the beginning .
when the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straig@@ ht@@ forward .
social activi@@ sts , business leaders , lawyers , politicians , profession@@ als will join the fac@@ ul@@ ty as active and on@@ going partici@@ pants in this we@@ dding of liberal education to the advan@@ cement of the public good .
and there will be and should be those who spend a lifetime pur@@ su@@ ing a very highly defined area of in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y .
okay , speaker la@@ wr@@ ence l@@ essi@@ g , right .
but they &apos;re very ke@@ en that we don &apos;t let money drop into that relationship , else it turns into something like this .
and so they &apos;re beautiful , but this liber@@ t@@ arian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this .
the point is they , he , here , gets that culture .
the cre@@ ator is a shar@@ ec@@ ro@@ pper in this story .
but then i went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been sil@@ enced .
it &apos;s a value respe@@ cting the cre@@ ator .
if they stick with the process , if they stick with it , they end up doing amazing things and they surprise themselves just how innovative they and their teams really are .
and they were holding it in their la@@ ps .
and this was really disap@@ poin@@ ting to dou@@ g , because before this time he was proud of what he did .
a few years ago i felt a l@@ um@@ p on the side of my ne@@ ck , and it was my turn in the mri machine .
it would be really great if you didn &apos;t let people divide the world into the crea@@ tives and the non-@@ crea@@ tives , like it &apos;s some go@@ d-@@ given thing , and to have people realize that they &apos;re naturally creative .
this is a picture of tim , who , right when i sna@@ pped this picture , reminded me , he said , &quot; j@@ essi@@ ca , the last lab group i worked in i was doing fiel@@ d@@ work in the co@@ sta ri@@ can rain@@ forest , and things have changed dramatically for me . &quot;
i am collabor@@ ating with charlie brown .
our bodies and homes are covered in microbes -- some good for us , some bad for us . as we learn more about the ger@@ ms and microbes who share our living spaces , fellow j@@ essi@@ ca green asks : can we design buildings that encourage happy , healthy micro@@ bi@@ al environments ?
and he was so inspired by this article , it kind of direc@@ ted the rest of his life .
by@@ te magazine and communications at the ac@@ m had special issues co@@ vering hyper@@ text .
there was a guy called g@@ ary kil@@ d@@ all who went flying his plane when ibm came looking for an operating system for the ibm pc , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see bill gates .
i think this means &quot; di@@ vine power of the ocean &quot; in a pol@@ yn@@ es@@ ian language .
everyone wants to hear their news an@@ ch@@ or say , &quot; mi@@ ster sp@@ las@@ h@@ y pants . &quot;
alex@@ is o@@ h@@ ani@@ an : how to make a sp@@ las@@ h in social media
i just wanted to use my skills and build a school .
in this school , there was a simple idea : to create comfort in a classroom .
the open@@ ings are letting the hot air out and light in .
usually , for a young man from gand@@ o to ear@@ n money , you have to leave the country to the city , sometimes leave the country and some never come back , making the community we@@ ak@@ er .
it &apos;s new technology . you look through them and the world you see is aug@@ mented with data : names of places , mon@@ um@@ ents , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
voice : if you total all the spots on a de@@ ck of cards , the result is 3@@ 65 .
mt : yeah , but i guess my hand is better . we beat the od@@ ds .
it is not . it is also shaped equally by history and culture .
and what does it mean ?
it doesn &apos;t work .
and the reason for this is , fir@@ stly , because the state in china is given a very special -- it enjo@@ ys a very special signifi@@ can@@ ce as the represent@@ ative , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment and the guar@@ dian of chinese civilization , of the civili@@ za@@ tion-@@ state .
and was finally comple@@ ted in the se@@ vent@@ h century a.@@ d.
what is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
here you have a me@@ gab@@ us , on the upper de@@ ck car@@ ries about 2,000 people .
acceler@@ ome@@ ters on each hand read hand position .
so i picked up my ban@@ jo and i nerv@@ ously played four songs that i actually knew with them .
like the time i was in sich@@ u@@ an provin@@ ce and i was singing for kids in rel@@ oc@@ ation schools in the earthquake disaster zone .
&quot; that &apos;s cool . &quot;
november 2005 : the streets are burning .
so with my friend mar@@ co , we decided to go there and see who are the real palest@@ ini@@ ans and who are the real israeli@@ s .
we &apos;re in ra@@ mal@@ la@@ h right now .
i called that project women are heroes .
but that &apos;s okay .
so you create a bridge between the media and the anony@@ mous women .
then art becomes useful .
each project -- that &apos;s a film from women are heroes .
we just did some pa@@ sting in los angeles on another project in the last weeks .
art can change the way we see the world .
and it &apos;s starting to look at -- not always and not for everything -- but in certain moments of time , access to certain kinds of goods and service will tr@@ um@@ p ow@@ ner@@ ship of them .
they did not invent car@@ -@@ sharing .
any gu@@ esses ?
so if i have a terri@@ fic experience and i t@@ we@@ et it , or i tell five people standing next to me , news tra@@ vels .
essentially , there are all sorts of restaurants in o@@ a@@ kl@@ and , near where i live .
li@@ sa gan@@ sky : the future of business is the &quot; mes@@ h &quot;
what happens in one place very quickly affec@@ ts everything else .
the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in gene@@ tics .
this could be our best century ever because of the achie@@ v@@ ements , or it could be our worst .
i don &apos;t play sports . i &apos;m really bad at sports .
i must have done about 3@@ 0,000 car@@ ic@@ atures .
anyway , the next slide i &apos;m about to show you -- should i just turn that off ?
so i decided , i &apos;m going to learn to paint by myself .
the best collaboration , of course , is with children .
i have to travel seven oceans , and i have to come and see you .
and you won &apos;t believe it , we put together a list of 7@@ ,000 people , who had made a difference -- a ridiculous list , but i was determined to bring them to india , so -- a lot of them were in india .
if they wanted beauty , i said , this is the beauty i &apos;m willing to give you . it &apos;s politi@@ ci@@ zed .
and two ma@@ gical things happened after he was born .
i whi@@ pped out my pen , and i started drawing on her head and i drew a cro@@ wn for her .
einstein &apos;s especially interested in pen@@ el@@ ope &apos;s talk .
e : &#91; squ@@ aw@@ ks &#93; sw : yeah , it sure can . but when einstein needs to rela@@ x from her job educ@@ ating the public , she lo@@ ves to take in the arts .
you like to drink water .
e : t@@ we@@ et , t@@ we@@ et , t@@ we@@ et .
why do we want to protect your home ?
so water was something that scared me to begin with .
and the tur@@ n@@ around in swimming came when a friend of mine said , &quot; i will go a year without any stimul@@ ants &quot; -- this is a six-@@ dou@@ ble@@ -@@ es@@ pres@@ so-@@ per@@ -@@ day type of guy -- &quot; if you can complete a one kilometer open water race . &quot;
and so his entire body really is underwater .
and i wouldn &apos;t even catch the response . a sad state of aff@@ air@@ s .
they were the normal high school curricul@@ um for japanese students -- the other 4@@ ,@@ 9@@ 99 students in the school , who were japanese , besi@@ des the american .
but no , you &apos;d be wrong because my body is very poor@@ ly designed for most things -- pretty well designed for li@@ f@@ ting heavy rocks perhaps .
i got a female instruc@@ tor first , to teach me the female role , the follow , because i wanted to understand the sensi@@ tivi@@ ties and abilities that the follow needed to develop , so i wouldn &apos;t have a repe@@ at of college .
so he uses a lead that foc@@ uses on his shoulder gir@@ d@@ le and his arm .
tim fer@@ ris@@ s : s@@ mas@@ h fear , learn anything
they found it much more mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tional , much more exciting than traditional education .
and i hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen .
this was a tradition in ancient war@@ fare called single com@@ bat .
and the she@@ pher@@ d boy takes one of his st@@ ones out of his pocket , puts it in his s@@ ling and roll@@ s it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes -- right here , in his most vulnerable spot -- and he falls down either dead or un@@ conscious , and the she@@ pher@@ d boy runs up and takes his s@@ word and cu@@ ts off his head , and the phili@@ st@@ ines see this and they turn and they just run .
they were incredibly accurate .
why is he being led by the hand by some young boy , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly , to the point of com@@ bat ?
the pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary tumor , as it grows , often starts to com@@ press the visual ner@@ ves in your brain , with the result that people with ac@@ ro@@ me@@ gal@@ y have either double vision or they are pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly near@@ si@@ gh@@ ted .
that night , i was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type 1 diab@@ e@@ tic in full-@@ blo@@ wn ke@@ to@@ aci@@ do@@ sis .
and what &apos;s amazing , when you use this technology , for example , looking at humans , we &apos;re not just covered in a sea of microbes .
there are risk factors associated with c@@ es@@ are@@ an se@@ ctions , some of those risk factors may be due to mis@@ -@@ coloni@@ zation when you car@@ ve a baby out of its mother rather than being deli@@ vered through the birth can@@ al .
now what these transplan@@ ts , these fe@@ cal transplan@@ ts , or the po@@ o tea suggest to me , and many other people have come up with this same idea , is that the micro@@ bi@@ al community in and on us , it &apos;s an organ .
but if you know anything about the history of britan@@ ni@@ ca since 196@@ 2 , it was anything but radical : still a very completely safe , sto@@ d@@ gy type of en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is the new york times website is a huge , enormous corporate operation with -- i have no idea how many hundreds of employees .
they hi@@ red experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality , and we were very pleas@@ ed with that result .
the reason for this is if we say we &apos;re only going to write the &quot; truth &quot; about some topic , that doesn &apos;t do us a dam@@ n bit of good of figuring out what to write , because i don &apos;t agree with you about what &apos;s the truth .
and we have over 40 ir@@ c chan@@ nels , 40 ma@@ iling li@@ sts .
the google test is , you look in google and see if it &apos;s there , because if something &apos;s not even in google , it probably doesn &apos;t exist at all .
and i always embar@@ r@@ ass her because i say , well , angel@@ a , for example , could get away with doing absolutely anything within wikipedia , because she &apos;s so admi@@ red and so powerful .
so the final point here is that to understand how wikipedia works , it &apos;s important to understand that our wi@@ ki model is the way we work , but we are not fan@@ a@@ tical web an@@ archi@@ sts . in fact , we &apos;re very flexible about the social metho@@ d@@ ology , because it &apos;s ultimately the passion of the community is for the quality of the work , not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it .
j@@ im@@ my wal@@ es : the birth of wikipedia
and the second question was , &quot; have you ever du@@ mp@@ ed somebody who really loved you ? &quot;
so , several years ago , i decided to look into the brain and study this ma@@ dness .
as the poet ter@@ ence , the roman poet once said , he said , &quot; the less my hope , the hot@@ ter my love . &quot;
it is a home@@ o@@ static im@@ balance .
as a matter of fact , in new york , i often catch myself looking in baby car@@ ri@@ ages and feeling a little sorry for the tot .
i think there &apos;s biology to that .
while many people respon@@ ded in different ways about our education system , my response to the high-@@ pressure environment was making bo@@ ws with pieces of wood found near my apartment building .
one : cur@@ ved ti@@ ps can ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the spr@@ ing@@ iness when you draw and shoot the ar@@ row .
did it stri@@ ke you ?
now the mother you see here is mu@@ gs@@ y .
and you can really feel the sound . that was my point with that .
but a second way to cra@@ ck the code is to develop some technology , an interface to do two-@@ way communication , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been trying to do in the ba@@ ham@@ as and in real time .
they could point at the visual object , or they could mi@@ mic the whist@@ le .
who@@ op . almost lost it .
i mean , imagine what it would be like to really understand the mind of another intelligent species on the planet .
so &quot; tem@@ ber@@ er@@ ana &quot; was these dreams , in which i would be running away from bad feelings -- is the only way i can put it .
ladies and gentlemen , an histor@@ ic flight has be@@ gun .
you are just in the element .
for example , last winter i began with ki@@ te sur@@ fing -- so new things .
so that was one of those cases where you let the wings go , right ?
we have a hundred years of experience .
so it was much sa@@ fer for me to land at the bottom .
but what normally pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed them also involved ye@@ ar@@ ning to know .
what were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stag@@ nation and ra@@ pid , open-@@ ended discovery ?
em@@ pi@@ ri@@ c@@ ism is in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate because , well , scientific theor@@ ies explain the seen in terms of the un@@ seen .
brains only detect nerve impul@@ ses .
what does that mean ? well , explanation is an as@@ ser@@ tion about what &apos;s there , un@@ seen , that accoun@@ ts for what &apos;s seen .
no easily imple@@ mented change could make that ti@@ lt cause the same seas@@ ons in both hemis@@ pher@@ es .
the problem is , there aren &apos;t enough eye care profession@@ als in the world to use the model of the deli@@ very of correc@@ tive eye@@ wear that we have in the developed world .

what was this place called min@@ to ?
they &apos;re open , these festi@@ v@@ als , because , like in min@@ to , they understand that the dialo@@ gue between the local and the global is essential .
festi@@ v@@ als pro@@ mote diversity , they bring neighbors into dialo@@ gue , they increase creativity , they offer opportunities for ci@@ vic pri@@ de , they improve our general psychological well-being .

i don &apos;t know why national geographic has done this , they &apos;ve never done this before , but they &apos;re allowing me to show you a few images from a co@@ verage that i &apos;ve just comple@@ ted that is not published yet .
now they &apos;re saying the sea ice in the arctic , the sum@@ mer@@ time extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years .

and just like the polar be@@ ars , these animals depend on an ic@@ y environment .
bring them out , check , and see how accurate you were .
that &apos;s why there &apos;s the cock@@ tail effect : when you &apos;re in a party , you &apos;re having conversations with someone , and yet you can recognize your name and you didn &apos;t even realize you were listening to that .
hi , sir , how are you ?
ar : would you be surprised if i could take it out of your hand ? say yes .
oh , that &apos;s where it was . go ahead and put it away .
i was che@@ cking mine . i couldn &apos;t find everything , but i noticed you had something here .
and now we &apos;ve got the digital revolution .
us@@ ha@@ hi@@ di is not only the software that we made .
&#91; most use technology to define the function . we use function to drive the technology . &#93; what if we could overcome the problem of un@@ reli@@ able internet and electricity and reduce the cost of connection ?
our team has basically been mul@@ es carrying components from the u.s. to kenya . we &apos;ve had very interesting conversations with cu@@ st@@ oms border ag@@ ents .
they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere , and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities , where the urban areas are much more warm than the ad@@ jac@@ ent rural areas , but we also have problems that , when we lose power , we can &apos;t open a window here , and so the buildings are un@@ in@@ habit@@ able and have to be made vac@@ ant until that air condi@@ tioning system can start up again .
and so you can imagine , even in this application , that in a high-@@ rise building where the pan@@ el systems go from floor to floor up to 30 , 40 flo@@ ors , the entire surface could be differ@@ enti@@ ated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface .
if you know about this tra@@ it , you can understand a lot of puzz@@ les about human behavior .
we think they must be blin@@ ded by religion , or by simple stu@@ pi@@ di@@ ty .
the first one is harm / care .
food is becoming extremely mor@@ alized no@@ wa@@ days , and a lot of it is ideas about pu@@ ri@@ ty , about what you &apos;re willing to touch , or put into your body .
i &apos;ll just flip through a few other slides .
but the &apos; 60s inevi@@ t@@ ably gives way to the &apos; 70s , where the cu@@ tt@@ ings of the a@@ per@@ tures hurt a little bit more .
i think that &apos;s probably right , although this is a contro@@ versi@@ al issue .
if you &apos;re high in openness to experience , revolution is good , it &apos;s change , it &apos;s fun .
but before you feel super@@ ior to george bush , before you throw a stone , ask yourself , do you accept this ?

situation &apos;s a little bit different where perhaps they know someone who &apos;s ho@@ sti@@ le , where they &apos;ve got someone shooting at them or doing something else that &apos;s clearly ho@@ sti@@ le , thro@@ wing rocks , whatever .
and since we &apos;ve already had so many problems with police use of non-@@ leth@@ al weapons in various ways , i thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context .
so it wasn &apos;t that que@@ ens@@ land had a particular problem with deaths from police sho@@ ot@@ ings and so on .
and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anes@@ thetic gas .
and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was argu@@ ing with the police offic@@ er .
so why is this relevant ?
and this is a particularly small s@@ co@@ ot@@ er for a gentle@@ man of this size .

this is the least glamorous magazine on the new@@ s@@ stand -- it &apos;s all about sex ti@@ ps .
and there &apos;s something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history . when the wit@@ ches cast a magic sp@@ ell on you , it was not in your self-@@ interest -- it was to get you to act against your interest .
what glamour is all about -- i took this from a bl@@ ur@@ b in the table of cont@@ ents of new york magazine , which was telling us that glamour is back -- glamour is all about tran@@ scen@@ ding the everyday .
and this is one reason that mo@@ des of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous .
&quot; to con@@ ce@@ al all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort &quot; : and this is one of the critical aspects of glamour .
it has that sense of going up and away , and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were -- particularly going down .
&quot; the matrix &quot; is a movie that is all about glamour .
and here &apos;s he@@ dy lam@@ ar@@ r .

i mean , you &apos;re clearly an incredible human being , but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not@@ -@@ tor@@ ture cham@@ ber , do acts that people here might be worried about .

but there &apos;s a very serious point , and i think that in the head@@ long d@@ ash of daily life , we often lose sight of the damage that this ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner form of living does to us .
now , if you think about how our world got so acceler@@ ated , the usual suspe@@ cts re@@ ar their heads .

the most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public ; 2@@ 10,000 people have or@@ dered these participa@@ tion k@@ its since we launched two years ago , which has raised around five million dollars , the majority of which , at least half , is going back into the legacy fund .

jonathan zit@@ train : the web as random acts of kin@@ dness
in our latest ass@@ ess@@ ment in 2009 , we measured 7@@ 4 school systems that together cover 8@@ 7 percent of the economy .
and i &apos;m making the size of the bubble propor@@ tional to the amount of money that countries spent on students .
and the bit@@ ter truth really is that , you know , not in many countries .
and even those people who compla@@ in and say that the relative standing of countries on something like pis@@ a is just an arti@@ fact of culture , of economic factors , of social issues , of hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty of societies , and so on , these people must now con@@ ce@@ de that education improvement is possible .
nine out of 10 japanese students say that it depends on my own investment , on my own effort , and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them .
and the most impres@@ sive outcomes of worl@@ d-@@ class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system .
we all live in the same planet , but there &apos;s still a great deal of poverty in the world .
and that is the perspective i have , and then i can start my story .
and after all , poor countries , like rich countries , one thing we &apos;ve got equal , is their days are the same length : 24 hours .
so the question was , i started looking at this issue , and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york .
and they had these bran@@ ches .
even in bangladesh , there are some empty places .
i &apos;ve been very surprised .
and the fact was that indian students studied harder than we did in sweden .
18@@ 5@@ 8 was the year when the coura@@ geous u@@ pris@@ ing against the foreign occu@@ pation of india was defe@@ ated by the british forces .
india was trying down here .
children started to go to school .
but on the other hand , gui@@ z@@ ho@@ u , one of the poorest in@@ land provin@@ ces of china , is there .
now , back to my proje@@ ctions .
can you see here what japan did ?
hans rosling was a young gu@@ est student in india when he first realized that asia had all the capac@@ i@@ ties to rec@@ la@@ im its place as the world &apos;s dominant economic force . at te@@ din@@ dia , he graph@@ s global economic growth since 18@@ 5@@ 8 and predi@@ cts the exact date that india and china will out@@ stri@@ p the us .
when those measu@@ rements are made , instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant , as a function of distance .
how do we see that galaxy ?
now , you can do an experiment tonight over the re@@ ception , ok , to figure out what that image will look like .
so what we can do , then , is based on how much di@@ stor@@ tion we see in those images , we can calculate how much mass there must be in this clu@@ ster .
so a little over a decade ago , two groups of physi@@ ci@@ sts and astronom@@ ers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slo@@ wing down , ok .
so , this is exactly what you want in physics : where a predi@@ ction comes out of a mathema@@ tically consi@@ stent theory that was actually developed for something else .
we &apos;re so excited to be here . it &apos;s such an honor for us .

it &apos;s that we expect them to bring us happiness .

but it didn &apos;t -- it never occurred to me that it had to be invented and that it had been invented only 350 years ago .
and the religious people said that if god wanted you to make -- i mean , god is everywhere , that was one of their rules , is god is everywhere .
so they were -- the really important part of this was , you were not supposed to talk about final causes , for instance .
it &apos;s been so cool since then .
i didn &apos;t take it personally , but -- i just -- i had -- i nai@@ vely had thought , until this sur@@ fing experience started me into the 17@@ th century , i &apos;d thought that &apos;s just the way people thought , and everybody did , and they recognized reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear .
just to see what would happen , if you mix@@ ed it together .
at any rate , i bring it up because it &apos;s a good story , and he said , tell personal things , you know , and that &apos;s a personal -- i was going to tell you about the first night that i met my wife , but that would be too personal , wouldn &apos;t it .

finally , my ple@@ a to you is to allow y@@ ourselves , and your children , and anyone you know , to kind of fi@@ dd@@ le with stuff , because it &apos;s by fi@@ dd@@ ling with things that you , you know , you comple@@ ment your other learning . it &apos;s not a replac@@ ement , it &apos;s just part of learning that &apos;s important .
and this seems quite a profound question .

well , you are to ride a bicycle , carrying your own weight and also some other weight , so that you can ear@@ n the bread for the day .
and it was that compassion which bo@@ ther@@ ed them , because when he saw -- in fact , he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car -- he drives his own car by the way -- and he saw in the rain , a family like the one that i showed to you getting dr@@ en@@ ched with an inf@@ ant .
and the nan@@ o team average age was just 27 years .
vol@@ k@@ swa@@ gon was 1@@ 1,@@ 3@@ 33 .
more importantly , they not only walk far to work , and not only do they cycle to work , but they cycle for work , as you can see here .
i &apos;ve been talking about getting more from less for more .
looks absolutely au@@ d@@ aci@@ ous .
it &apos;s about ultra@@ -@@ low cost .
that &apos;s the new world that we want to create .
but then he held it for a little while , lak@@ sh@@ m@@ i .
engineer ra ma@@ shel@@ k@@ ar shares three stories of ultra@@ -@@ low-@@ cost design from india that use bot@@ tom@@ -up re@@ thinking , and some clever engineering , to bring expensive products into the realm of the possible for everyone .
i &apos;m fortunate enough to be part of one .
and i thought , you know , is this the best way to do it ?
so going back to what i was saying before about all power being produced -- well , other than photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic -- being produced by this bo@@ iling of ste@@ am and turning a tur@@ bine , that &apos;s actually not that efficient , and in fact , in a nuclear power plant like this , it &apos;s only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient .
and this is really important , because the reaction st@@ ops .
and people say , &quot; oh , well , you &apos;ve launched this thing , and it &apos;s radio@@ active , into space , and what about accidents ? &quot;
now , there &apos;s an anti@@ do@@ te to commodi@@ ti@@ zation , and that is custom@@ i@@ zation .
you like your fan@@ t@@ asy environments , your fake , your dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land experiences .
that has -- the whole quality movement has ris@@ en with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years .
all right , now , there is value for fake .
think about dis@@ ney again .
but surro@@ und the bre@@ wing of that coffee with the ambi@@ ance of a star@@ bucks , with the authenti@@ c ce@@ dar that goes inside of there , and now , because of that authenti@@ c experience , you can charge two , three , four , five dollars for a cup of coffee .
and this really came about from having many different kinds of interests .
and because the wi@@ sh@@ bone is bone -- it &apos;s animal -- it &apos;s sort of a point where i think we can enter into it .
and then , i got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of ero@@ tic art , and i didn &apos;t have any pieces .
but then in the end , what i decided was every time you finish writing the word , i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road .
one of the fascinating things about what we were actually working on is that we were seeing , using new kinds of scan@@ ning technologies , things that had just never been seen before -- i mean , not only in disease management , but also things that allowed us to see things about the body that just made you mar@@ vel .
and as we kept on working on this data , looking at small clu@@ sters of the body , these little pieces of tissue that were a tro@@ pho@@ bl@@ ast coming off of a bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ st , all of a sudden bur@@ ro@@ wing itself into the side of the u@@ ter@@ us , saying , &quot; i &apos;m here to stay . &quot;
and it &apos;s not just our own existence , but how does the woman &apos;s body understand but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking imm@@ un@@ ological , car@@ dio@@ vas@@ cular system that basically is a mobile system that can actually nur@@ ture , treat this child with a kind of mar@@ vel that is beyond , again , our com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion -- the magic that is existence , that is us ?
so i invest@@ ed more than eight months just studying the profile of this star .
a star is the most simple object .
it was incredible . the only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a super@@ no@@ va explosion in this system , which pollu@@ ted the atmosphere of this star .
and if you find one , i will say that this is something related to seti , because naturally you can &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s exactly the same game . a very tiny feature .
if you see , in the spectrum of a planet host star , if you see strange chemical elements , it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it .
so , i &apos;ll start with this : a couple years ago , an event plan@@ ner called me because i was going to do a speaking event .
i was like , &quot; really ? &quot; and he was like , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
and it turned out to be shame .
they believe they &apos;re worthy .
they talked about the will@@ ing@@ ness to say , &quot; i love you &quot; first , the will@@ ing@@ ness to do something where there are no guaran@@ te@@ es , the will@@ ing@@ ness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammo@@ gram .
and this is a therap@@ ist who sees therap@@ ists , because we have to go to those , because their b@@ .@@ s. meters are good .
why do we struggle with it so much ?
you cannot selec@@ tively num@@ b .
let me tell you what we think about children .
bren@@ é brown studies human connection -- our ability to em@@ pa@@ thi@@ ze , bel@@ ong , love . in a po@@ ig@@ nant , funny talk , she shares a deep insight from her research , one that sent her on a personal quest to know herself as well as to understand humanity . a talk to share . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor .
so , if we want to act more effectively in the world , we have to get to know ourselves better .
but it &apos;s a story until we conver@@ t it to data and so what we do , this concept we had , was to take steven &apos;s status , &quot; what is my status ? &quot;
here is an m@@ .@@ s. patient .
and i want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years .
i want to solve a problem . i want an application .
because the blue line is a better line . the red line is way down@@ hill , the blue line is a good line .
this is not just graphics .
can we do the even harder thing ? can we go to the patients that actually decided to stay on li@@ thi@@ um , because they were so convinced they were getting better ?
first time we ever tried it . we &apos;ll try to get it better later but 12 months so far .
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s nothing normal about this .
carbon at the nano@@ scale is actually transparent and flexible .
knowing that we &apos;re not going to put fif@@ ty of these in our bas@@ ements to store our power , we went to a group at university of texas at d@@ all@@ as , and we gave them this diagram .
it &apos;s a picture of a little girl dying of thir@@ st .
what &apos;s happening here ? how can this be possible ?
so the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
and what is the overall distribution of control ?
about 10 years ago , mr. tr@@ on@@ ch@@ et@@ ti pro@@ ver@@ a had ow@@ ner@@ ship and control in a small company , which had ow@@ ner@@ ship and control in a bigger company .
it &apos;s not a street map . &quot;
there &apos;s even a software called c@@ ad@@ nan@@ o that allows us to design three-dimensional shapes like nan@@ o robots or drug deli@@ very systems and use dna to self-@@ assem@@ ble those functional structures .
and when i throw this up into the air and catch it , it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein , all of the intri@@ c@@ ac@@ ies .
and this allows us to simu@@ late this self-@@ assembly behavior and try to optimi@@ ze which parts are folding when .
this is a completely program@@ ma@@ ble and adap@@ tive pi@@ pe on its own .
no human lands on all f@@ ours like that .
scientists change the answer to &quot; how fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom ? &quot;
i didn &apos;t expect to get in , and my family had no money for college .
tu@@ es@@ day night it &apos;s school violence and bu@@ ll@@ ying .
in fact , what we &apos;ve found is that every single business outcome impro@@ ves .
even a mobile phone , it &apos;s a computer .
bad blocks . but any@@ ways , the to@@ f@@ u to me was kind of my origin , basically .
after that , things kind of got strange , and i got thinking about the computer , because the computer to me always , kind of , bo@@ ther@@ ed me .
it &apos;s not like print . it &apos;s not like video .
and this computer &apos;s programm@@ ed to do only one thing , which is , if you move your mouse , the mouse changes on the screen .
and i &apos;ll never forget how , like , but -- i &apos;ll never forget how , like , he had a sudden situation with his -- he had an an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm .
i made -- i took my old ma@@ cin@@ to@@ sh@@ es and made different objects out of them from to@@ k@@ yo .
so , this is , like , in front of the ei@@ ff@@ el tower , really , actually , around the lou@@ v@@ re area .
and there ris@@ d appeared .
so the point here is that not all boys exist within these ri@@ gi@@ d boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls , and not all girls exist within those ri@@ gi@@ d boundaries of what we think of as girls .
guess what ?
i want to write about this really interesting world .
third reason that boys are out of syn@@ c with school today : kinder@@ garten is the old second grade , folks .
we can design better games .
it &apos;s very un@@ comfortable to be on the recei@@ ving end of that kind of language .
let &apos;s see where this hypo@@ thesis is going to lead us .
the bubble would then expand at the speed of light , inv@@ ading all space , and turning the higgs field from the familiar state into a new state .
theore@@ tical physi@@ ci@@ sts always ask &quot; why &quot; questions .
the biggest surprise of disco@@ vering the higgs bo@@ son ? that there were no surpris@@ es . gi@@ an gi@@ u@@ di@@ ce talks us through a problem in theore@@ tical physics : what if the higgs field exists in an ultra@@ -@@ dense state that could mean the collapse of all atom@@ ic matter ? with wi@@ t and char@@ m , gi@@ u@@ di@@ ce out@@ lines a gri@@ m fa@@ te -- and why we shouldn &apos;t start wor@@ rying just yet .
we &apos;d put them in an environment where they didn &apos;t want to be , and they didn &apos;t want to do what we wanted them to do .
and it &apos;s pretty simple , really .
so this is the bit i &apos;m really scared of .
it &apos;s just about , i want to create some great experiences .
you may never experience the entire thing yourself .
and there are histor@@ ic attemp@@ ts that have had some level of technical success .
for those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground , this may be counter@@ -@@ intuitive , but driving has po@@ th@@ ol@@ es , co@@ b@@ ble@@ st@@ ones , pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans , other dri@@ vers and a rather long and deta@@ iled list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to con@@ tend with .
am@@ d : see , we &apos;re all ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly excited about that little bun@@ ny ho@@ p .
and mo@@ bility to your dest@@ ination is clearly solved .
now , you &apos;ll still have about three billion pounds left in change , and people will ask for the tra@@ ins to be slo@@ wed down .
there are even records of people being execu@@ ted for ref@@ using to grow po@@ tat@@ oes .
so , the bizarre thing , which is ba@@ ff@@ ling to conventional , classi@@ cally trained economists , is that a weird little s@@ mi@@ ley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a £ 60 fine and three pen@@ alty points .
now , we basically have to change our views slightly .
every country has a con@@ tex@@ tual al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic drink . in france it &apos;s per@@ no@@ d .
have any of these diam@@ ond shapes gone out ?
but this is both hy@@ ster@@ ically funny -- but i think an important philosop@@ hi@@ cal point , which is , going forward , we need more of this kind of value .
i was spending all my time practic@@ ing .
we humans are earth &apos;s p@@ and@@ or@@ an species .
and if the very few that survive pass onto their off@@ spring whatever it was that helped them survive , then those off@@ spring must be better adap@@ ted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were .
darwin didn &apos;t , of course ; he didn &apos;t know about genes .
but a lot of these problems can be avo@@ i@@ ded by remember@@ ing the definition .
audience : ba@@ th@@ room so@@ ap .
there are two repli@@ cat@@ ors now on this planet .
we put the stor@@ age of memes out there on a clay tab@@ let , but in order to get true te@@ mes and true te@@ me machines , you need to get the variation , the selection and the cop@@ ying , all done outside of humans .
just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy .
the genes are forced into producing all this m@@ ye@@ lin , all the fat to my@@ el@@ in@@ ate the brain .
one that is obviously happening all around us now , is that the te@@ mes turn us into te@@ me machines , with these im@@ plants , with the drugs , with us mer@@ ging with the technology .
my wife sent me a message , &quot; who@@ a , earthquake , &quot; and then disappeared for 25 minutes .
and@@ re told me , after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way , that there is no new research here .
and the fellow in the v@@ est there , craig toten , he has pus@@ hed forward to get docum@@ entation out to all the groups that are doing this .
they told me that they had the right model of the patient -- that they knew what was the right thing to do to mini@@ mi@@ ze my pain -- and they also told me that the word patient doesn &apos;t mean to make sugge@@ sti@@ ons or to inter@@ f@@ ere or ...
and it turns out it &apos;s a more general case -- there &apos;s a lot of mistakes we do .
for some people , we vari@@ ed how much money they could get away with -- how much money they could ste@@ al .
in fact , even when we gave self-@@ dec@@ lar@@ ed athei@@ sts the task of swe@@ aring on the bible and we give them a chance to che@@ at , they don &apos;t che@@ at at all .
i &apos;ll tell you what i think about this and the stock market in a minute .
and at pit@@ ts@@ burgh there are two big universi@@ ties , car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on and university of pit@@ ts@@ burgh .
i think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market .
so if i was to ask you what the connection between a bottle of ti@@ de deter@@ gent and swe@@ at was , you &apos;d probably think that &apos;s the easi@@ est question that you &apos;re going to be asked in e@@ din@@ burgh all week .
and you can see here some photographs from london where bar@@ cla@@ ys spon@@ sor@@ ed the city bike sche@@ me , and some activi@@ sts have done some nice piece of gu@@ er@@ ri@@ ll@@ a marketing here and doc@@ tor@@ ed the slo@@ gan@@ s .
so ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly it &apos;s a currency at the moment that &apos;s pur@@ ely for the kind@@ le .
so this currency becomes credit , which again , is really , really interesting .
and my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how their tissu@@ es and organs work when everything &apos;s going right , rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong , like so many of you .
most of the time it &apos;s a flexible organ .
and this was the point at which my graduate ad@@ vis@@ er said , &quot; who@@ a ! hold on . slow down . &quot;
and one thing kept bo@@ ther@@ ing me , and that &apos;s , when they &apos;re func@@ tioning , pen@@ ises don &apos;t wi@@ g@@ gle .
i really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies .
so i asked nat@@ al@@ ie , what do i do ?
then we d@@ ated for two years , broke up for 10 , got back together and got married .
d@@ l : how fast ?
sorry , i hate to carry on ...
so i &apos;d like to share with you a story about a self-@@ study , self-@@ empower@@ ing computer science course that i built , together with my brilliant colleague no@@ am nis@@ an .
and para@@ g sha@@ h , another engineer , from mumbai , has un@@ b@@ und@@ led our projects into smaller , more mana@@ ge@@ able bit@@ es that he now ser@@ ves in his pione@@ ering do@@ -@@ it-@@ yourself computer science program .
well , in my opinion , we went too far with this non@@ sense , and gra@@ ding became degra@@ ding .
now , i don &apos;t know how many people here are familiar with the term &quot; mensch . &quot;
it is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts .
it is time to be asking questions about technology .
your mobile phone , computer and game con@@ so@@ le have a bloo@@ dy past — tied to tan@@ tal@@ um mining , which fun@@ ds the war in the democratic re@@ public of the congo . drawing on his personal story , activ@@ ist and refuge@@ e band@@ i m@@ bub@@ i gives a stir@@ ring call to action .
and they would all be leg@@ ally compli@@ ant by doing this boo@@ king .
and the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all .
and i think i can see a few eyes rolling .
so , tax@@ i jour@@ ne@@ ys might be one example .
this is a world of atom@@ ized capitalism .
so a few of the stories .
co@@ al-@@ powered industrial revolution in this country -- oil , gas , sorry .
so , ur@@ ani@@ um , which is very big , wants to split .
and you make if from li@@ thi@@ um . that reaction at the bottom , that &apos;s li@@ thi@@ um 6 , plus a neutr@@ on , will give you more helium , plus tri@@ ti@@ um .
and in fact we can make fusion happen .
but we can &apos;t aband@@ on it now ; we have to push forward , get fusion to happen .
in fact , it attra@@ cted ac@@ col@@ a@@ des from multin@@ ational organizations because of its economic growth .
if , however , the core issues that prop@@ elled the revolution aren &apos;t add@@ ressed , the consequences could be catastrop@@ hi@@ c -- not just for egypt , but for the entire region .
now i know what some of you are thinking .
what drives men &apos;s support for women &apos;s emplo@@ yment is men &apos;s emplo@@ yment , their level of education as well as a high score on their country &apos;s u.n. human development index .
we &apos;re finding it 11 times more powerful than email .
but the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
nan@@ cy lu@@ bli@@ n : tex@@ ting that sa@@ ves lives
one year later , the next dec@@ lar@@ ations of im@@ possibilities began .
we call it rock@@ et@@ c@@ am .
in 2008 , it flew for a wh@@ opp@@ ing 20 seconds , a year later , two minutes , then six , eventually 11 .
today we are making met@@ als that are ligh@@ ter than sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am , so light they can sit at@@ op a dan@@ deli@@ on pu@@ ff and be blo@@ wn away with a wis@@ p of air -- so light that you can make a car that two people can lift , but so strong that it has the crash@@ -@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess of an su@@ v .
the internet is home to two billion people , or 30 percent of the world &apos;s population .
i guess in some way , i sort of believe it &apos;s supposed to be hard .
rd : yeah , yeah . it did .
and you have to re@@ visit these questions over time .
my job is one of the most ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating jobs you could have .
there is no way back home .
and i &apos;ve been ri@@ ding with these kids once a week , every tu@@ es@@ day , rain or sh@@ ine , for the last four years and by now , they &apos;ve become a very big part of my life .
and i &apos;m just standing there , watching this scene with a complete dis@@ belief , not knowing what to do .
he &apos;s a 17@@ -year-old .
you know , perspective is one of these cri@@ tically important life-@@ cop@@ ing strategies that mountain bi@@ king can really teach you .
and only now , &quot; he says , &quot; i &apos;m beginning to understand where i am , and i actually like it . &quot;
it &apos;s no longer val@@ id or real .
and it is important .
dr. phy@@ lli@@ s lee gave me my interview , and she asked me , &quot; how would you define race ? &quot;
but there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is on@@ eness , our essen@@ ce .
and over time and with practice , i &apos;ve tried to live more and more from my essen@@ ce .
and there on the smaller scale , the scale of an ear@@ ring or a cer@@ am@@ ic pot or a musical instrument , was a materi@@ ality and a sou@@ l@@ ful@@ ness .
the brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy .
and instead , we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us .
there &apos;s 250 pa@@ vili@@ ons .
so we were trying to think , how could we make a whole thing e@@ man@@ ate .
and i just wanted to show you .
and that &apos;s my final slide .
there are also , i think , increasing results from the scientific study of humans that , indeed , we &apos;re not born blan@@ k sl@@ ates .
the fore@@ most is that if we &apos;re blan@@ k sl@@ ates , then , by definition , we are equal , because zero equ@@ als zero equ@@ als zero .
it &apos;s not clear , by the way , since then , whether that is an accurate gener@@ alization , but the data at the time seemed to support that .
there are , of course , entirely new art forms and new media , many of which you &apos;ve heard over these few days .
by the way , this is one sentence -- you can actually par@@ se it .
that would make them super-@@ similar , right ?
but , this is a tou@@ ch@@ y subject , and i work for the discovery channel , and we want to portra@@ y ac@@ cur@@ ately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
albert reach@@ es in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rub@@ ber band but what comes out instead is a kni@@ fe .
and he says , &quot; like the human@@ e society ? &quot;
i go in , i grab the sc@@ ro@@ tum , tip comes off .
literally , the transition from ignor@@ ance to knowledge is an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is .
you &apos;ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desper@@ ate to relate to every four years , right ? &quot;
he &apos;s making a great living .
so , i &apos;m 40 feet off the de@@ ck , which is like looking down at the top of your sho@@ e , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
if there &apos;s a plum@@ ber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant bu@@ tt cra@@ ck . admit it .
and to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that i got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the te@@ sti@@ cles on my ch@@ in .
i &apos;ve got night@@ m@@ are disorder , which is categ@@ ori@@ zed if you have rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ent dreams of being pur@@ su@@ ed or dec@@ lar@@ ed a failure -- and all my dreams invol@@ ve people ch@@ asing me down the street going , &quot; you &apos;re a failure . &quot;
he beat someone up or something , and he decided to fake ma@@ dness to get out of a prison sentence .
and i was in prison a@@ waiting trial , and my cell@@ mate said to me , &apos; you know what you have to do ?
how do you cross your legs in a san@@ e way ?
he was a psychop@@ ath .
and i e@@ ma@@ iled him and i said , &quot; i believe you may have a very special brain an@@ om@@ aly that makes you special and interested in the predat@@ ory spirit and fe@@ ar@@ less .
can i go through them with you ? &quot;
and the ge@@ ms are always the ou@@ ter@@ most aspects of our intervie@@ we@@ e &apos;s personality .
but she &apos;s married , so i &apos;m going to have to get her split up from her husband . &quot;
now , consider religion -- in this case islam , which is the religion that , in some direct sense , can be said to be pre@@ ci@@ pit@@ ating what we &apos;re about to enter .
and the same problem with respect to islam .
what i want to suggest to you , though , in the next couple of minutes is that there &apos;s also a hop@@ eful response to this .
they were actually blo@@ cked from even forming a party under the political system there . why ?
well , what i &apos;m here to say then is , for people who are skep@@ tical about the war , it &apos;s especially important to recognize that in the after@@ math of the war there is a possibility for the government of the united states and the muslim peop@@ les with whom it inter@@ acts to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly islamic .
and the local se@@ ab@@ ir@@ d rescu@@ e center , named san@@ c@@ co@@ b , immediately launched a massive rescu@@ e operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescu@@ e ever under@@ taken .
personally , i really didn &apos;t know if i was capable of hand@@ ling such a mon@@ str@@ ous task .
and we used this technique again during the treas@@ ure rescu@@ e .
and this is cri@@ tically important because , one year ago , the african pengu@@ in was dec@@ lar@@ ed en@@ danger@@ ed .
we call it propag@@ anda gar@@ den@@ ing .
and we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the le@@ tter@@ box before we start , and most importantly of all , we are not da@@ un@@ ted by the sophisticated arguments that say , &quot; these small actions are meaning@@ less in the face of tomorrow &apos;s problems , &quot; because i have seen the power of small actions , and it is awesome .
we &apos;ve created a company . we are designing and building an aqu@@ apo@@ ni@@ cs unit in some land that was sp@@ are at the back of the high school , like you do , and now we &apos;re going to be growing fish and vege@@ tables in an or@@ ch@@ ard with bees , and the kids are helping us build that , and the kids are on the board , and because the community was really ke@@ en on working with the high school , the high school is now teaching agriculture , and because it &apos;s teaching agriculture , we started to think , how could we then get those kids that never had a quali@@ fication before in their lives but are really excited about growing , how can we give them some more experience ?
more than 30 to@@ w@@ ns in england now are sp@@ inning the incredible edi@@ ble plate .
and i &apos;m inten@@ sely gr@@ ateful for the opportunity to speak to you today .
in the qu@@ ran , religious opinion -- religious or@@ tho@@ do@@ x@@ y -- is dis@@ missed as &quot; z@@ an@@ na : &quot; self-@@ in@@ dul@@ gent gu@@ ess@@ work about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other , but which makes people quar@@ rel@@ some and stu@@ pi@@ dly se@@ ct@@ arian .
scrip@@ ture , he says , &quot; teach@@ es nothing but charity , and we must not leave an interpretation of scrip@@ ture until we have found a com@@ passionate interpretation of it . &quot;
and my ho@@ sts in pakistan said , &quot; look , don &apos;t be too poli@@ te to us .
that is the e@@ tho@@ s found , too , in all the religions .
so that &apos;s just the eye of the bee with a microscope , and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called om@@ mati@@ dia , and they actually have sensory ha@@ irs in their eyes so they know when they &apos;re right up close to something , because they can &apos;t see in stere@@ o .
the pe@@ tal of that flower looks like that , so the ant is kind of cra@@ w@@ ling over these objects , and if you look a little bit closer at this stig@@ ma and the stam@@ en here , this is the style of that flower , and you notice that it &apos;s got these little -- these are like little jell@@ y-@@ like things that are what are called sp@@ urs . these are ne@@ ct@@ ar sp@@ urs .
so when i first looked at this , i was -- i thought , ge@@ e , this is like a little treas@@ ure tro@@ ve here .
look at this hole in the middle . that hole was caused by a micro@@ me@@ te@@ ori@@ te hit@@ ting the moon .
and i do really like this shot , because it shows all the de@@ tri@@ tus that &apos;s sort of embedded in the so@@ le of the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers .
and i &apos;m sure ross can associ@@ ate that with design .
so , still working with film , i &apos;m afraid .
but people do don@@ ate their bodies to art and science .
the lor@@ ry goes in front of it . and it takes sli@@ ces of x-@@ rays through the lor@@ ry .
if you look at this , just the tube , it is quite bright .
and i had a ma@@ c classic . and it &apos;s a little box .
that &apos;s what i do .
your consciousness , the you@@ -@@ ness of you , the me-@@ ness of me -- that gets this one go .
i &apos;m very lucky , because he &apos;s better than all the other children .
i &apos;m sitting on a train .
does science ru@@ in the magic of life ? in this gr@@ um@@ py but char@@ ming mon@@ olo@@ gue , ro@@ bin in@@ ce makes the argument against . the more we learn about the astonishing behavior of the universe -- the more we stand in a@@ we .
maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
it is not professor and con@@ vi@@ ct , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
and then life was fine , d@@ and@@ y .
and everything i saw in the cul@@ tiv@@ ation said there were huge fi@@ ghts amongst the fo@@ o@@ dies between the cul@@ tiv@@ ators and the h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ ers .
would there be time to be able to work with it ?
well , he was the former oil minister of nigeria under president ab@@ ach@@ a , and it just so happens he &apos;s a con@@ vi@@ cted money la@@ under@@ er too .
he did business with global banks .
a recent study by the world bank looked at 200 cases of corruption .
after many months of dig@@ ging around and reading through hundreds of pages of court docum@@ ents , we found evidence that , in fact , shell and en@@ i had known that the fun@@ ds would be trans@@ fer@@ red to that shell company , and frankly , it &apos;s hard to believe they didn &apos;t know who they were really dealing with there .
i &apos;m very worried today about this notion , this world , this pre@@ vail@@ ing kind of force of security .
you must fight anyone who en@@ cro@@ ach@@ es upon it .
one of the amazing things that i &apos;ve discovered in my tra@@ vels is that there is this emerging species .
there &apos;s a young woman named car@@ r@@ ie re@@ th@@ le@@ f@@ sen in min@@ nes@@ ota .
real security is con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating death , not pre@@ ten@@ ding it doesn &apos;t exist .
when i start to pre@@ tend that what i &apos;m seeing isn &apos;t impac@@ ting me , and isn &apos;t changing my heart , then i get in trouble .
but upon arri@@ val there , in the fall of 198@@ 6 , and doing a lot of interviews , i found that the only thing i was offered was to be assi@@ stant to the art director at al@@ fre@@ d a. knopf , a book publi@@ sh@@ er .
so there you are .
but who@@ ever it is , i can &apos;t help but thinking they wo@@ ke up one day like , &quot; oh my god , that wasn &apos;t there last night . o@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ h@@ h !
the answer was the most low-@@ tech thing you can imagine .
don &apos;t get me started .
we &apos;re talking a 9@@ 0@@ 0-@@ page book that is as weird as it is comp@@ elling , and fe@@ atur@@ ing a cli@@ ma@@ c@@ tic scene in which a hor@@ de of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sle@@ eping girl and cause a german she@@ pher@@ d to explo@@ de .
kids can be full of inspiring as@@ pi@@ rations and hop@@ eful thinking .
now , what &apos;s even worse than restri@@ ction is that adults often under@@ estimate kids abilities .
no , really , we are going to be the next generation , the ones who will bring this world forward .
well , i was wrong . what i learned from these en@@ counter@@ s was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evalu@@ ate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life .
but here &apos;s a picture of lincoln me@@ a@@ dow taken after , and you can see that from the perspective of the camera or the human eye , hardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place , which would con@@ firm the log@@ ging company &apos;s con@@ ten@@ tion that there &apos;s nothing of environmental impact .
horri@@ fied , my colleagues rema@@ ined behind to gather his thoughts and to record whatever he could the rest of the afternoon , and that evening , he captured a remarkable event : the l@@ one survi@@ ving male be@@ a@@ ver swimming in slow circles crying out in@@ con@@ sol@@ ably for its lost mate and off@@ spring .
they forced us to learn things like latin .
you had to have an even better imagination to play this game , &quot; death ri@@ der . &quot;
43 percent of gam@@ ers are female .
it &apos;s like that guy obviously had some pain while making it .
you need to be really an incredible artist .
it is because i have had life-@@ alter@@ ing experiences in virtual space , and video games had be@@ gun to ero@@ de my own understanding of what is real and what is not .
i know what i want and i do it .
video games are fun , engaging , and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re-@@ progra@@ mming .
the same with students or highly creative people , writers and people like that .
where better to challenge those minds than here at ted ?
and what that means : &quot; simple and under@@ stand@@ able &quot; might not be actually simple or under@@ stand@@ able , and things we think are &quot; complex &quot; might be made simple and under@@ stand@@ able .
so , another thing that we do is to conf@@ use adult sophisti@@ cation with the actual understanding of some principle .
no matter what the shapes were , the growth law is the same .
and we can reflect here the way gil@@ li@@ an is@@ hi@@ j@@ im@@ a did .
so what i &apos;m doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image , about a fifth of a second later , like that . and they &apos;re getting faster and faster each time , and if i st@@ ack these guys up , then we see the differences ; the increase in the speed is constant .
with all the inten@@ sity and brilli@@ ance for which he is known , al@@ an kay en@@ visi@@ ons better techniques for teaching kids by using computers to illu@@ strate experience in ways - – mathema@@ tically and scienti@@ fically -- that only computers can .
this is where it &apos;s really central to our lives .
it &apos;s going to probably change the human lifes@@ pan .
it &apos;s too ris@@ k-@@ a@@ verse .
that &apos;s the focus of my book &quot; re@@ designing humans , &quot; where i talk about the kinds of choices we &apos;ll make , and the challenges it &apos;s going to present to society .
but when something is fe@@ asi@@ ble in thousands of labor@@ at@@ ories all over the world , which is going to be the case with these technologies , when there are large numbers of people who see them as bene@@ ficial , which is already the case , and when they &apos;re almost impossible to police , it &apos;s not a question of if this is going to happen , it &apos;s when and where and how it &apos;s going to happen .
this is the flo@@ wer@@ ing of human en@@ dea@@ vor . &quot;
where there is this bloo@@ dy , awful mess happens .
thank you .
and we lay our eggs there , we don &apos;t have to worry about other eggs or anything like that .
like , how do they know that &apos;s the time ?
so we put in dogs ma@@ ting , and , you know , we &apos;re watching it , and she &apos;s totally absor@@ bed .
the only real problem with the as@@ cen@@ ding a@@ or@@ ta in people with mar@@ fan syndro@@ me is it lac@@ ks some ten@@ si@@ le strength .
every patient we do has an absolutely bes@@ po@@ ke im@@ plant .
this is a list of the core team .
research and eth@@ ics commit@@ tee : if you want to do anything new in surgery , you have to get a license from your local research and eth@@ ics .
they don &apos;t want to change .
you can shor@@ t@@ cut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have .
yeah well , you guys are making my life miser@@ able because track pa@@ ds used to be round , a nice round shape .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
they wanted to sti@@ r up contro@@ ver@@ sy .
there was an ethni@@ c side to this conflict as very often in africa .
i mean , they didn &apos;t agree with each other -- that was not the point .
and for dictat@@ ors all over the world , the good news is when carto@@ oni@@ sts , journ@@ alists and activi@@ sts shut up .
so , in 2000 we wrote &quot; rare earth . &quot; in 2003 , we then asked , let &apos;s not think about where ear@@ ths are in space , but how long has earth been earth ?
well , we know from astro@@ biology that we can really now predict what &apos;s going to happen to our particular planet .
the ch@@ al@@ k itself &apos;s com@@ posed by plan@@ k@@ ton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor , so that 90 percent of the se@@ di@@ ment here is skelet@@ on of living stuff , and then you have that milli@@ me@@ ter-@@ thick red layer , and then you have black rock .
you know , you &apos;re ga@@ zing upon your very distant ancestors .
war@@ m-@@ bloo@@ ded animals take a huge hit at this time .
and we know who was there . at the end of the per@@ mi@@ an , at many of these mass extin@@ ction boundaries , this is what we find : is@@ or@@ en@@ ier@@ at@@ ene . it &apos;s very specific .
and i throw this slide in -- this is me , actually , two months ago -- and i throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal , cham@@ ber@@ ed n@@ au@@ til@@ us .
six hours later , up goes the temperature .
i &apos;ve just got one question for you , peter .
every year when it comes to the cot@@ ton harv@@ est , the government shu@@ ts down the schools , puts the kids in bus@@ es , bus@@ es them to the cot@@ ton fields to spend three weeks harv@@ est@@ ing the cot@@ ton .
the main american manufac@@ tur@@ er of that active ingre@@ dient decided a few years ago to rel@@ oc@@ ate to china because it &apos;s the world &apos;s biggest supp@@ li@@ er of pig@@ s .
and the simple answer is they can &apos;t . they &apos;re national .
if the in@@ spec@@ tor did come along , it would be amazing if they were able to res@@ ist the bri@@ be .
transparency is absolutely critical to this .
&quot; you want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain .
so i appe@@ al to you .
you will put the wind in win@@ some , lose some .
okay , so these are three things i know to be true .
so i did and stood ama@@ zed every week when these brilliant , grow@@ n-@@ up po@@ ets laugh@@ ed with me and gro@@ an@@ ed their sym@@ pathy and cla@@ pped and told me , &quot; hey , i really felt that too . &quot;
at a certain point , you would realize that someone has the exact same thing , or one thing very similar , to something on your list .
i use spoken word to help my students re@@ discover wonder , to fight their instin@@ cts to be cool and un@@ fa@@ zed and , instead , ac@@ tively pur@@ sue being engaged with what goes on around them , so that they can rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ t and create something from it .
and i wondered whether i &apos;d get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out , or not .
they feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it .
i &apos;d like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motiv@@ ated me to become a docum@@ entary photographer .
seeing the war created such incredibly high sta@@ kes for everyone involved and that visual journ@@ alism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution -- i wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer .
at the same time in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released from prison , the black population com@@ men@@ ced the final phase of liber@@ ation from a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
the next day i left for rwanda , and it was like taking the express elev@@ ator to hell .
after the fall of su@@ har@@ to in indones@@ ia , i began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards moder@@ ni@@ zation .
the international community still hasn &apos;t found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this geno@@ cide .
last year i spent several months docum@@ enting our wo@@ unded tro@@ ops , from the bat@@ t@@ le@@ field in iraq all the way home .
you see , even if the idea of the election is perfect , running a coun@@ tr@@ y@@ wide election is a big project , and big projects are mess@@ y .
and on each bal@@ lot form there is this en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted value in the form of this 2@@ d bar@@ code on the right .
david bis@@ mark : e-@@ vot@@ ing without frau@@ d
so we went on and we looked in wikipedia , we found this map .
otherwise it was only christian countries .
most of them are in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
but let me illu@@ strate that fourth factor by looking at q@@ at@@ ar .
we are still deb@@ ating peak oil , but we have definitely reached peak child .
the rest will grow older and get two billion children .
she gave birth ; i caught the baby ; i got off the island ; i landed in san francisco ; and all the press wanted to talk to me because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in indian aff@@ air@@ s .
in the year that larry page and ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in -- with whom i have a certain affe@@ ction and a new aff@@ ili@@ ation -- in the year in which they were born , two million people died of smallpox .
197@@ 4 , we were down to five countries .
but smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradi@@ cation .
ar@@ a@@ v@@ ind , which started as a se@@ va project , is now the world &apos;s largest and best eye hospital .
then there &apos;ll be secon@@ dar@@ y out@@ breaks , and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won &apos;t know what hit you .
and what i thought i would call it is &quot; early dete@@ ction , &quot; but it should really be called &quot; total early dete@@ ction . &quot;
they reported this to who . who took a little while taking action because who will only receive a report from a government , because it &apos;s the united nations .
but first , let &apos;s just take three numbers .
but first , let &apos;s think of customers .
so think about that .
people sometimes think that 100 percent &apos;s going to be hard , and we &apos;ve had the conversation in the business .
a solar pan@@ el pa@@ ys for itself in seven or eight years .
so we know for our 17@@ ,000 mana@@ gers across i@@ ke@@ a that 47 percent are women today , but it &apos;s not enough , and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management .
i was born into a family of poli@@ tically active , intellectual athei@@ sts .
and it can be sort of cra@@ z@@ y-@@ making , housing both the my@@ stic and the war@@ ri@@ or in one body .
or someone from the other side of the abor@@ tion conflict .
and since we had establi@@ shed some trust , we believed in each other &apos;s sin@@ cer@@ ity .
in 2007 , i traveled to three war z@@ ones .
today the general is a b@@ ap@@ ti@@ zed christian ev@@ ange@@ list .
the com@@ man@@ der told me that a woman could g@@ auge a potentially violent situation much better than men .
now , hundreds of homes were destroyed .
juli@@ an , welcome .
and when ki@@ bak@@ i got into power -- through a co@@ ali@@ tion of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya -- they com@@ mission@@ ed this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
yeah , we see two birds &#91; heli@@ cop@@ ters &#93; , and we &apos;re still fir@@ ing .
j yeah .
that &apos;s what they see every day .
and part of the al@@ b@@ ani@@ an government was in this , etc . , etc .
and i think i read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
instead , they publi@@ ci@@ zed your side .
what you just heard are the interactions of bar@@ om@@ et@@ ric pressure , wind and temperature read@@ ings that were recorded of hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e no@@ el in 2007 .
when you step closer , you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers .
artist na@@ th@@ al@@ ie mie@@ b@@ ach takes weather data from massive stor@@ ms and turns it into complex sculp@@ tures that em@@ body the forces of nature and time . these sculp@@ tures then become musical sc@@ ores for a string quar@@ tet to play .
most of the others either never respon@@ ded back , said they didn &apos;t have the time or didn &apos;t have the equipment and couldn &apos;t help me .
and she &apos;s standing in front of you and she &apos;s explaining to you that little kids will eat their vege@@ tables if they &apos;re different colors .
it &apos;s a huge problem .
na@@ om@@ i sha@@ h : hi everyone . i &apos;m na@@ om@@ i sha@@ h , and today i &apos;ll be talking to you about my research invol@@ ving in@@ door air quality and asth@@ matic patients .
so i want you to imagine that you &apos;re in jul@@ ie &apos;s shoes , or someone who &apos;s really close to you who suff@@ ers from asth@@ ma or another lung disorder .
and air quality and air pollu@@ tan@@ ts have a huge impact on the lung health of asth@@ matic patients , anyone with a res@@ pir@@ atory disorder and really all of us in general .
and the whole room , including me , was like , &quot; yeah . &quot;
what is a sexy body ?
and the only purpose that these legs can serve , outside the context of the film , is to provo@@ ke the senses and ig@@ ni@@ te the imagination .
it is our humanity , and all the potential within it , that makes us beautiful .
i remember that in the year of 1990 , when i was gradu@@ ating from college , i was appl@@ ying for a job in the sales department of the first five-@@ star hotel in beijing , great wall sher@@ at@@ on -- it &apos;s still there .
how are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of china , or at large , the world ?
so how are they different ?
for those who do return back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , they find themselves very welcome lo@@ cally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assi@@ stance of the internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , up@@ grade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
and fortunately , we have seen the government respon@@ ding more ti@@ m@@ ely and also more frequ@@ ently to the public concern@@ s .
i guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
but getting down can be a challenge for small cu@@ bs .
but how to reach it ?
some of the world &apos;s astronom@@ ers have telescop@@ es near@@ by .
culture where creativity was consum@@ ed but the consumer is not a cre@@ ator .
but most important was that bm@@ i took public do@@ main works and made arr@@ ange@@ ments of them , which they gave away for free to their sub@@ scri@@ bers . so that in 19@@ 40 , when as@@ cap threat@@ ened to double their rates , the majority of broad@@ ca@@ sters swit@@ ched to bm@@ i .
and i .@@ ...
and on the other side , among our kids , there &apos;s a growing copyright abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ism , a generation that reje@@ cts the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do , reje@@ cts copyright and belie@@ ves that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignor@@ ed and to be f@@ ought at every opportunity possible .
we can &apos;t make our kids passi@@ ve again .
jack say , &quot; me , ma@@ ma@@ -@@ san , could we spend the night here ?
its power emer@@ ges when someone else agre@@ es to believe the lie .
they &apos;re ready to give you something for whatever it is they &apos;re hungry for . &quot;
think dan@@ te , shakespeare , the bible , news of the world .
trained li@@ es@@ po@@ t@@ ters get to the truth 90 percent of the time .
and we all do it no matter how powerful you are .
they &apos;re going to say , &quot; hey , maybe it was those guys in pay@@ roll that for@@ ged those che@@ cks . &quot;
there &apos;re going to be times when someone makes one expression while mas@@ king another that just kind of lea@@ ks through in a fl@@ ash .
don &apos;t try to be like those folks on &quot; law &amp; amp ; order &quot; and those other tv shows that pu@@ m@@ mel their subjects into sub@@ mission .
and these technologies are going to be market@@ ed to all of us as pan@@ ac@@ e@@ as for dec@@ eit , and they will prove incredibly useful some day .
it &apos;s been an incredible few days .
if you want to know about africa , read our literature -- and not just &quot; things fall apart , &quot; because that would be like saying , &quot; i &apos;ve read &apos; gone with the wind &apos; and so i know everything about america . &quot;
but these are not new to africa .
and i was growing up in school and the federal government didn &apos;t want us taught about the history of the war , because they thought it probably would make us generate a new generation of re@@ bel@@ s .
in the film , &quot; sometimes in april &quot; by ra@@ ou@@ l pe@@ ck , i@@ dr@@ is el@@ ba is po@@ is@@ ed in a scene with his ma@@ che@@ te raised , and he &apos;s being forced by a crowd to cho@@ p up his best friend -- fellow rwand@@ an army offic@@ er , al@@ b@@ eit a tu@@ ts@@ i -- played by fr@@ as@@ er james .
and i asked millions of people , without questi@@ oning my right to do so , to go up against the government .
the fact that it happens in &quot; another country &quot; takes you quite by surprise .
in this deeply personal talk , nigeri@@ an writer chris ab@@ an@@ i says that &quot; what we know about how to be who we are &quot; comes from stories . he sear@@ ches for the heart of africa through its po@@ ems and narrative , including his own .
they take re@@ al-@@ time data and immediately feed it back into the product .
and so they took a bit of time to learn about that .
ultimately , co@@ ke &apos;s success depends on one cru@@ cial fact and that is that people want a coca@@ -@@ cola .
and i think we make a fundamental mistake -- we make an assu@@ mption , that we think that , if people need something , we don &apos;t have to make them want that .
can you you believe that ?
so what &apos;s the end@@ game ?
in her talk , mel@@ in@@ da gates makes a provo@@ ca@@ tive case for non@@ prof@@ its taking a cu@@ e from corpo@@ rations such as coca@@ -@@ cola , whose pl@@ ug@@ ge@@ d-@@ in , global network of marke@@ ters and distribu@@ tors en@@ sur@@ es that every remote village wants -- and can get -- a co@@ ke . why shouldn &apos;t this work for con@@ dom@@ s , san@@ itation , vaccin@@ ations too ? &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
this is what many diver@@ s would consider par@@ ad@@ ise .
these have disappeared from every in@@ hab@@ ited reef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and patho@@ gens .
but , little did i know , until i jum@@ ped for the first time in a marine reser@@ ve .
huge abund@@ ance of grou@@ pers inside the reser@@ ve , and the closer you get to the reser@@ ve , the more fish you have .
now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 diver@@ s one month per year , the reven@@ ue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
it &apos;s a top down hierarch@@ ical structure where people wait for government ag@@ ents to come and this is not effective . and the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
they re@@ produce very slowly ; they have a slow metaboli@@ sm ; and , basically , they just maintain their bio@@ mass .
but the best feeling is this bi@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a that e.@@ o. wilson talks about , where humans have this sense of a@@ we and wonder in front of un@@ tam@@ ed nature , of raw nature .
we have to have a very special technology to get into that un@@ familiar world .
you hear about giant squ@@ id and things like that , but some of these animals get up to be appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 1@@ 40 , 1@@ 60 feet long .
the height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the al@@ ps in most cases .
and we started to wonder for a long time , how did it all get down there ?
everything you see is played out in the pit@@ ch black of the deep sea .
so here , you &apos;ve got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pill@@ ars and hot spr@@ ings and volcan@@ ic er@@ up@@ tions and earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es , in@@ hab@@ ited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground .
that &apos;s probably where we evolved from .
oceans come and go . mountains come and go . gl@@ aci@@ ers come and go .
this stuff is also really easy to rele@@ ar@@ n , provided you have a really strong gro@@ unding in reas@@ oning . math reas@@ oning -- we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us -- this is hard to teach .
notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formul@@ a somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compu@@ te .
and we realize how great would it be if we just had some a , b , c and d lab@@ els to talk about them more easily .
so now we have the real deal .
i encourage math teachers i talk to to use multi@@ media , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shor@@ test question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the text@@ book is helping you in all the wrong ways : it &apos;s buying you out of your ob@@ li@@ gation , for patient problem solving and math reas@@ oning , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful .
the whole ha@@ dr@@ on colli@@ der family needs un@@ lo@@ cking .
at the age of 14 , in common with many 14@@ -@@ year-olds in the brazi@@ li@@ an education system , he dropped out of school .
the other half have one parent because the other parent has died through aids .
so if you look , as i did , through this tour , and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions , look at the reci@@ pes that they come up with for learning , they look nothing like school .
that &apos;s too long if you &apos;re poor .
it has 3@@ 0,000 children on those building sites .
it &apos;s reli@@ able and people know exactly where they are .
and as i said , the trouble with this is that , in the developing world there just aren &apos;t teachers to make this model work .
it &apos;s an amazing thing .
the finding love and respect , the part about trying to find your place in the world .
i clean up . this is not an actual photograph of my son &apos;s room ; his is m@@ essi@@ er .
you too might be gay ! because i know some gay people who are also single .
some of you may be calling it , what , the constit@@ ution of the united states , is that what you call it too ?
i figured if i was a bit ir@@ rever@@ ent , you wouldn &apos;t find it serious .
and they should be treated with love and respect .
we tend to see common@@ alities more than differences .
as you may know , the entire world oper@@ ates on a universal law : entrop@@ y , the second law of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics .
for me , it began as i was approach@@ ing my third act , my 6@@ 0@@ th birthday .
and over time , these neural path@@ ways become hard@@ wired , they become the nor@@ m -- even if it &apos;s bad for us because it causes us stress and an@@ x@@ iety .
and the answer of course , like so many things in the world , is sex .
and they get up to all sorts of tricks .
i mean , i think that looks like some sort of flying animal or be@@ ast .
now if you think that &apos;s fabulous , this is one of my great favor@@ ites .
so what is an inse@@ ct seeing ?
when we think of games , there &apos;s all kinds of things .
so this is zig in this photograph . this is also one of zig &apos;s photographs . he &apos;s a photographer .
this was the boat . it was made quickly obviously .
and i also made a game about the tra@@ il of te@@ ars .
this is a project called flight patterns .
and you can see , over time , the ways the air@@ por@@ ts change .
and it &apos;s based on the pre@@ mis@@ e that there are certain things that are easy for people , but really difficult for computers .
the amount of time spent drawing ran@@ ged from four seconds to 4@@ 6 minutes .
we decided to use the mechanical tur@@ k for exactly what it was meant for , which is making money .
you type in your code , but you first test your mic .
and we started boun@@ cing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project .
you &apos;re hearing a person &apos;s life .
so this should really be seen at home with you typ@@ ing in your own address , but i &apos;m going to give you a little pre@@ view of what you can expect .
and i chose the language of sil@@ hou@@ ette because graphi@@ cally it &apos;s very efficient .
so this spider goes through the whole alphab@@ et with identical ad@@ jec@@ tives and substan@@ tives .
other ones are historical .
i was also interested in the physi@@ c@@ ality of this form@@ at , because you have to walk to see it .
here it &apos;s an artist book installation called &quot; identity project . &quot;
and each time i make public art , i want something that &apos;s really relevant to the place it &apos;s inst@@ alled .
it &apos;s a story about transformation and connections .
and it &apos;s what story cutting is all about .
and according to how you answer that question , people are either incredibly deli@@ gh@@ ted to see you , or look at their watch and make their exc@@ uses .
there is one really big problem with this , and that problem is en@@ vy .
so that &apos;s another way in which something that is quite positive can have a na@@ sty ki@@ ck@@ back .
i am a mer@@ it@@ o@@ cr@@ at in that sense .
in other words , they have failed . and they are described as &quot; los@@ ers . &quot;
we &apos;ve put people on the moon . we &apos;ve done all sorts of extraordinary things .
thing about a successful life is , a lot of the time , our ideas of what it would mean to live success@@ fully are not our own .
but at the end of the day we should always remember that who@@ ever is facing us , whatever has happened in their lives , there will be a strong element of the ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ard .
and i &apos;m not in the present what@@ so@@ ever .
try going in with an ar@@ ma@@ da like we had of 50 people and five bo@@ ats and c@@ nn &apos;s cre@@ w , etc .
but no , for some reason i couldn &apos;t wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing , &quot; a heard you kno@@ cking at my cell@@ ar door i love you baby and i want some more ooh , ooh , the damage done &quot; the night before i started , i finished stephen haw@@ king &apos;s &quot; the grand design . &quot;
the most ven@@ om@@ ous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jell@@ yfish .
they either die or they quickly get to a hospital .
and they can send the po@@ ison into the system .
i can feel proud . i can stand here in front of you tonight and say i was coura@@ geous .
and so i ask myself , i &apos;m starting to ask myself now , even before this extreme dream gets achieved for me , i &apos;m asking myself , and maybe i can ask you tonight too , to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase the poet mary oli@@ ver , she says , &quot; so what is it , what is it you &apos;re doing , with this one wild and pre@@ cious life of yours ? &quot;
and of course , the des@@ i@@ red range -- trying to keep glu@@ co@@ se between 75 and less than 200 , che@@ cking it every five minutes in a continu@@ ous glu@@ co@@ se sensor -- you &apos;ll see how that can impact diabetes .
i didn &apos;t want to take my shirt off to show you , but i can tell you it &apos;s on .
i didn &apos;t have one of those , but i got the fit@@ bit .
of course how many here have any problems with sle@@ eping ?
eigh@@ ty percent of americans have chr@@ onic disease , or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have two or more chr@@ onic disease , 1@@ 40 million americans have one or more chr@@ onic disease , and 80 percent of our 1.@@ 5 , whatever , trillion expen@@ di@@ tures are related to chr@@ onic disease .
so , we can change medicine across the continu@@ um of care , across the ages from pre@@ mies or un@@ born children to sen@@ i@@ ors ; the pharma@@ ceu@@ tical ar@@ ena changes ; the full spectrum of disease -- i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of that -- across the globe .
we lose 7@@ 0@@ 0,000 people a year in the u.s. from sudden car@@ di@@ a@@ c death .
pollution , energy shor@@ tage , environmental diversity , poverty .
a person comes out , they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do , and then , when it &apos;s time to go back for a billion years -- or a million , i forget , the numbers don &apos;t matter -- but there really aren &apos;t very many people on earth at a time .
and it &apos;s very hard to find an eth@@ ic@@ ist who consi@@ ders any change worth making , because he says , what about the consequences ?
genetic algorithms are great for certain things ; i suspe@@ ct i know what they &apos;re bad at , and i won &apos;t tell you .
and so a few years ago -- f@@ ours years ago , actually -- i set out to say , is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder ?
one of our philosop@@ hi@@ es in the book is that no dish is really intrin@@ si@@ cally any better than any other dish .
so you photograph that in exactly the same position , and then you can sub@@ stit@@ ute in -- and that part does use photo@@ shop -- just the ed@@ ges .
as you move side to side , it moves off .
we have a chapter on gel@@ s .
but you think to yourself , &quot; i &apos;m not quite sure what &apos;s wrong with this guy .
and he is cre@@ di@@ ted with doing over 4,000 of these public sur@@ ger@@ ies , wander@@ ing around in europe , which is an astonishing number , when you think that surgery must have been a last res@@ ort .
the question had to be asked , &quot; well , can we do these same sur@@ ger@@ ies but through little in@@ c@@ isi@@ ons ? &quot;
and so here you &apos;re seeing the operation of this wr@@ ist .
but if you need to reach more places than just one , you need to move the robot .
it &apos;s very exciting to think where we get to go with this .
so , with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all , and we can see it all .
in 2011 , we visited the van@@ cou@@ ver waste transfer station and saw an enormous p@@ it of plastic waste .
as a result , they easily escape into our environment .
then we monit@@ ored ph@@ th@@ al@@ ate utili@@ zation and bacteri@@ al growth , and found that they shared an in@@ verse cor@@ relation , so as bacteri@@ al populations increased , ph@@ th@@ al@@ ate concent@@ rations decre@@ ased .
if we &apos;re making plastic synthe@@ tically , then we think the solution would be to break them down bio@@ chemi@@ cally .
too much rain falls on some areas , and not enough on others .
so now we &apos;re going to go through that door of furniture .
this is a relatively famous chair .
and again , they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype of a house -- architecture , very expensive medium .
but anyway , i remember the cut gra@@ pe@@ fruit that we would have at the e@@ ames house when i was a kid .
ed : okay , good .
and we could have been born 100,000 years ago .
and i think that all of us in this room , as you move design forward , it &apos;s not about just doing one thing .
and i think that this is all part of sur@@ ren@@ der@@ ing to the design journey .
like this : agricultural workers in africa , whi@@ pped and be@@ aten , showing us how they were be@@ aten in the fields before they es@@ cap@@ ed from sla@@ very and met up with our film cre@@ w .
if the rule of law is sound , it prote@@ cts the poor and it prote@@ cts the vulnerable .
if you look at a long-term chart , prices are at historical lows and yet global demand for forced labor is still real strong .
you buy them che@@ ap@@ ly , you use them , you cru@@ mp@@ le them up , and then when you &apos;re done with them you just throw them away .
buying people out of sla@@ very is like paying a bur@@ gl@@ ar to get your television back ; it &apos;s ab@@ et@@ ting a crime .
this is what liber@@ ation really looks like .
now , it &apos;s quite an old phenomenon ; it was discovered 100 years ago .
but what happens to the super@@ conduc@@ tor when we put it inside a magnetic field ?
and this extremely thin layer is able to levi@@ tate more than 7@@ 0,000 times its own weight .
and so this ma@@ gical transformation is what i was trying to get at with my project , which became known as the to@@ aster project .
and of course , it wasn &apos;t actually a working mine anymore , because , though ray was a min@@ er there , the mine had closed and had been re@@ opened as a kind of tour@@ ist attra@@ ction , because , of course , it can &apos;t compe@@ te on the scale of operations which are happening in south america , australia , wherever .
that &apos;s me getting mi@@ ca .
so there &apos;s a picture of my to@@ aster .
and that really describes information technology .
because i had them through 2002 in my book , &quot; the sing@@ ul@@ arity is near . &quot;
because if you double one percent seven more times , which is exactly what happened , you get 100 percent . and the project was finished on time .
what now fits in our po@@ ckets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years .
ray kurz@@ weil &apos;s latest graph@@ s show that technology &apos;s break@@ ne@@ ck advan@@ ces will only acceler@@ ate -- rec@@ ession or not . he un@@ vei@@ ls his new project , sing@@ ul@@ arity university , to study on@@ coming tech and guide it to benefit humanity .
but they had not had any time to ev@@ acu@@ ate any belon@@ g@@ ings .
voice 2 : come get inside here .
that &apos;s a very powerful idea , and it &apos;s a very powerful reality .
but there is a dark side to this , and that &apos;s what i want to spend the last part of my talk on .
but we know that occasi@@ onally ants go a@@ stra@@ y , and what happens is that , if army ants are wander@@ ing around and they get lost , they start to follow a simple rule -- just do what the ant in front of you does .
i got a day job , and my ni@@ ghts and wee@@ ken@@ ds are already filled up with things like , let &apos;s supply water to the world , and power to the world , and educ@@ ate all the kids , which , chris , i will not talk about . i don &apos;t need another mission .
they take the load off , and it becomes , again , compli@@ ant .
and i hope you &apos;ll appreciate the level of global co@@ verage that it managed to achieve .
but the roman@@ s developed sal@@ ting .
so it allows us to sample these amazing habit@@ ats that are very far from the surface and very far from light .
they went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in new york city and they bar@@ co@@ ded it .
and what we see is that for co@@ ast@@ al tags , for those organisms that live near the shor@@ eline , they &apos;re most diverse in the tro@@ pic@@ s .
but it was only discovered in the early 198@@ 0s .
and so that turns out to be about two million species once all is said and done .
and so the grand challenge then is to try and make sure that we preser@@ ve what &apos;s left , because there is still spectacular beauty .
it &apos;s called ple@@ ach@@ ing , or gra@@ f@@ ting trees together , or gra@@ f@@ ting in@@ o@@ sc@@ u@@ late matter into one con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous , vas@@ cular system .
fellow and urban designer mit@@ ch@@ ell jo@@ ach@@ im pres@@ ents his vision for sustainable , organic architecture : eco@@ -@@ friendly abo@@ des grown from plants and -- wait for it -- meat .
and you know what i found out ?
it is an elev@@ ation of us beyond ourselves .
so , here we are .
movement is the only way you have of affec@@ ting the world around you .
there &apos;s no competition at all .
and it sounds like an easy problem .
you want to generate beliefs about the world .
if you &apos;re playing against a very good op@@ pon@@ ent , they may distribu@@ te it in that green area , which is the pri@@ or distribution , making it hard for you to return .
so i get two sources .
and as we go from n@@ au@@ ght to 0.@@ 1 second , it becomes more ti@@ ck@@ li@@ sh .
and the game is very simple .
and i can hold my arm in a particular jo@@ int con@@ figu@@ ration either very sti@@ ff or very rela@@ x@@ ed .
so what i can show you here is how the vari@@ ability of the movement will evolve if i choose that way .
d@@ w : so people have found out for example that studying vision in the ab@@ sen@@ ce of reali@@ zing why you have vision is a mistake .
this is a vi@@ king lan@@ der photograph of the surface of mars .
we believe there &apos;s some water in the polar cap@@ s , there are polar cap@@ s of north pole and south pole .
the most intrigu@@ ing and puzz@@ ling measu@@ rement , in my opinion , we &apos;ve ob@@ ta@@ ined of mars , was released earlier this year in the magazine science .
but look in the southern hemis@@ ph@@ ere .
we pre@@ program it .
the rocket engine begins .
we are on the ver@@ ge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the earth &apos;s atmosphere .
and she said , &quot; no , the lego is the treas@@ ure . &quot;
the lego guys don &apos;t give you any ro@@ y@@ al@@ ties , str@@ angel@@ y , but some user made this and then it sold .

they committed that they &apos;re going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent , and their new stores by 30 percent , and do all that in seven years .
consumers don &apos;t really like these light bul@@ bs .
because california was the first state in this country to man@@ date 25 percent reduction of greenhouse g@@ ases by 20@@ 20 .
the fourth and final lesson we &apos;ve learned is about the potential of radical innovation .
but i &apos;m really afraid we need much , much more .
it is the mother of all markets . you remember that internet ?
and this spre@@ ads on out end@@ less@@ ly into a distance .
but things don &apos;t just diff@@ use in human populations at random .
a. and you have an immedi@@ ate appreci@@ ation that a is going to be more likely to get the thing that &apos;s spreading and to get it so@@ on@@ er by virtu@@ e of their struc@@ tural location within the network .
and that happens at every peri@@ pher@@ al no@@ de .
we &apos;re going to take daily cu@@ ts through the network for 120 days .
well , some other scientists have esti@@ mated what would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample of these 1000 people , 300 people and imm@@ uni@@ zed them .
or we can monitor doctors prescri@@ bing behaviors , passi@@ vely , and see how the diff@@ u@@ sion of innovation with pharma@@ ceu@@ tic@@ als occur@@ s within &#91; networks of &#93; doctors .
at these lar@@ ge-@@ scale construction sites in china , you see a sort of ma@@ k@@ es@@ hi@@ ft camp where workers live during the entire building process .
they typically make the best out of their conditions , and try to make their spaces look nice and hom@@ ey , or at least up until as far as they can reach .
they &apos;re des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of farmers who began migr@@ ating from the upper egypt in the &apos; 4@@ 0s , and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over ca@@ ir@@ o .
what moved me the most was that despite these seem@@ ingly in@@ hospit@@ able conditions , i was wel@@ com@@ ed with open arms into a home that was made with love , care , and un@@ reser@@ ved passion .
but fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time .
when soldiers came across ro@@ ad@@ side bom@@ bs in iraq and afghanistan , instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and po@@ king with a stick , as they used to do up until about 2002 , they now send the robot out .
the eyes are on the screen there .
they go to fac@@ tories around the country .
but over the next 40 years , it &apos;s going to change dramatically , even in china .
let me show you how it works .
what you &apos;re looking at in here is a 3d vie@@ wer that we developed that would allow the display and manipu@@ lation of &#91; the &#93; cloud of points in real time , cutting se@@ ctions through them and extra@@ cting dimensions .
two years ago , we were approach@@ ed by a partner of ours to digit@@ ally preser@@ ve an important her@@ it@@ age site , a un@@ es@@ co her@@ it@@ age site in uganda , the royal kas@@ u@@ bi tom@@ bs .
and dou@@ g pri@@ tch@@ ard , who &apos;s the head of visu@@ alization at the glas@@ go@@ w school of art .
and the reason i give you this moment is there &apos;s a deep truth in it .
they have launched a di@@ v@@ est@@ ment campaign that has now convinced , i think , 55 universi@@ ties in 22 states to di@@ v@@ est their hol@@ dings of sto@@ cks with reg@@ ard to companies doing business in sud@@ an .
and the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st culture that we have in this country makes americans , sort of , more pr@@ one to , i think , want to bring never again to life .
he was drawn to the fl@@ ames , he ch@@ ased the fl@@ ames , he was like a mot@@ h to the fl@@ ames . something of an ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in jun@@ k@@ ie .
he then goes to rwanda and to congo in the after@@ math of the geno@@ cide , and he &apos;s the guy who has to decide -- hu@@ h , ok , the geno@@ cide is over ; 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people have been killed ; the people responsible are fle@@ eing into neighbor@@ ing countries -- into congo , into tanz@@ ania .
like a refuge@@ e . because he represents the u.n.
but by the end of his life , i think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from .
in times of fear , for instance , one of the things ser@@ gi@@ o used to say is , fear is a bad ad@@ vis@@ or .
for most people , if they think about hunger , they don &apos;t have to go far back on their own family history -- maybe in their own lives , or their parents &apos; lives , or their grand@@ parents &apos; lives -- to remember an experience of hunger .
this isn &apos;t one of those rare diseases that we don &apos;t have the solution for .
so this bur@@ den of knowledge drives me .
and this is cli@@ ma@@ te-@@ proof .
camer@@ o@@ on , northern camer@@ o@@ on , boom and b@@ ust cycles of hunger every year for decades .
and what &apos;s happened in the past year alone is the da@@ ir@@ y industry -- where this card &apos;s used for milk and yo@@ gur@@ t and eggs and hum@@ mus -- the da@@ ir@@ y industry has gone up 30 percent .
the fact is studies show that the cost of mal@@ nutrition and hunger -- the cost to society , the bur@@ den it has to bear -- is on average six percent , and in some countries up to 11 percent , of gdp a year .
and the point of the article was that we have gotten re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist in our view of biology , in our view of cancer .
because evolution doesn &apos;t care about us after we &apos;ve had our children .
so , hopefully , we will go from being the art of medicine more to the science of medicine , and be able to do what they do in infe@@ c@@ tious disease , which is look at that organism , that bacteria , and then say , &quot; this antibio@@ tic makes sense , because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it . &quot;
it &apos;s what we call a system .
and i didn &apos;t realize that for three hours i &apos;m sitting at my desk , and i &apos;m not moving at all .
it &apos;s never been shown .
the power of these magne@@ ts , the power of what we can do here , is that we can see an individual neutr@@ on with this technology .
you don &apos;t need to shr@@ ink the disease .
when it hit that dete@@ ctor is dependent on the mass and the charge .
this is sur@@ f .
so , ask yourself : is this person ever going to drive at a ste@@ ad@@ y 28 miles per hour ? i don &apos;t think so .
they are all important . and every brand needs to have gui@@ del@@ ines at the center .
playing sound effects both pleas@@ ant and awful , juli@@ an treas@@ ure shows how sound affec@@ ts us in four significant ways . listen carefully for a sho@@ cking fact about no@@ is@@ y open-@@ plan off@@ ices .
he &apos;s trying to find and solve water issues , the crisis around the world .
we looked at each other with these looks of dis@@ belief at what we had just comple@@ ted .
for me , as a scientist , it all began in 195@@ 3 when i first tried sc@@ u@@ ba .
tim worth says the economy is a wh@@ oll@@ y-@@ owned sub@@ si@@ di@@ ary of the environment .
to see -- wait a minute , we can go k@@ sh@@ h@@ pl@@ ash ! -- right there , ha -- under the ocean , see what the whales see .
we &apos;re still killing blu@@ ef@@ in tuna ; truly en@@ danger@@ ed and much more valuable alive than dead .
and in 18@@ 72 , with yel@@ lo@@ w@@ stone national park , the united states began establi@@ shing a system of parks that some say was the best idea america ever had .
we need new ways , better ways , to cop@@ e with poverty , wars and disease .
i &apos;m obsessed with insects , particularly inse@@ ct flight .
they have anten@@ na@@ e that sense od@@ ors and detect wind dete@@ ction .
now i realize that it is a little bit absur@@ d to compare the behavioral re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of a human to a fly .
but let &apos;s think about this . how can you make a small number of neurons do a lot ?
it &apos;s part of their visual gui@@ dance system .
why are we doing this ?
99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes .
they were so successful in evolution that what we did was to du@@ pli@@ cate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull .
they choose very carefully who they connect with .
we can position them in different places , ori@@ ent them in different places .
here we activ@@ ate it . and this gives the first gli@@ mp@@ se of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation .
steve told us about the future of little technology ; i &apos;m going to show you some of the past of big technology .
it was the first project funded by ar@@ pa .
they built a high-@@ explo@@ sive prop@@ elled model .
this is cre@@ w com@@ partment . it swit@@ ches , so what &apos;s up@@ side down is right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode .
not yours , of course -- other people &apos;s .
people write me about their personal experience , and about their examples , and what they dis@@ agree , and nu@@ ances .
turns out they &apos;re identical .
when you ask people this question , they usually think that it has to be something about culture .
the countries on the right , the ones that give a lot , have a slightly different form .
and because we have no idea what to do we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us .
now think of it . this decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replac@@ ement .
this was an ad from the economist a few years ago that gave us three choices .
and as a consequence , people chose it .
the behavioral economics perspective is slightly less gener@@ ous to people .
the way we trans@@ mit wireless data is by using electro@@ magnetic waves -- in particular , radio waves .
it &apos;s good for a nice sun@@ tan , but otherwise dangerous for the human body .
and it has a very nice ac@@ ute property .
and that &apos;s a video , a high-@@ definition video that is transmit@@ ted through that light be@@ am .
if the whole world would deplo@@ y them , you would save hundreds of power plants .
in hospitals , for new medical instruments ; in streets for traffic control .
i thought i &apos;d take a moment to tell you what a genome is .
everything that happens in digital is conver@@ ted , or a repres@@ entation , of a one and a zero .
the first human genome took 10 years , three billion dollars .
most importantly , what we &apos;re learning is that nature has provided us a spectacular to@@ ol@@ box .
so , we could , you know , focus on disease resistance ; we can go for higher yi@@ el@@ ds without necessarily having dramatic far@@ ming techniques to do it , or costs .
and , you know , people would always ask james wat@@ son -- he &apos;s not always the most poli@@ tically correct guy ...
and if we don &apos;t make that a reward in training , that will be a di@@ stra@@ ction .
of course , female dogs , bit@@ ches , on the other hand , have several bit@@ ch am@@ end@@ ments to male hierarch@@ ical rule .
the dog doesn &apos;t speak english , or american , or span@@ ish , or french .
basically , we follow a low-@@ frequency behavior -- one the dog doesn &apos;t want to do -- by a high-@@ frequency behavior , common@@ ly known as a behavior problem , or a dog ho@@ bby -- something the dog does like to do .
and so we have to en@@ force , but without force .
how are you going to re@@ pri@@ m@@ and a gri@@ zz@@ ly bear ?
i &apos;m standing right here with my bag .
it &apos;s as if there &apos;s some scha@@ den@@ freude there , that we actually take de@@ light in people getting things wrong , so that we can then mo@@ an and gro@@ an and bit@@ ch at them .
ah , dam@@ n , i wanted to end exactly on time , but i got eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two -- so thank you very much . that &apos;s my talk , thank you .
the book had three , yours had four .
wk : yeah .
i &apos;m kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it .
that &apos;s the thing .
i want to talk to you briefly about perception .
it &apos;s a multipli@@ cation of two prime numbers .
four across , four up and down -- it &apos;s 16 .
they yi@@ eld to the sli@@ gh@@ test movement or motion or emotion .
how did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
and more than that , it &apos;s a con@@ fe@@ ction of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transi@@ stors .
but the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accu@@ mu@@ late , never become combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
and the answer is about half a second .
they &apos;re in bi@@ stro@@ s and caf@@ es and restaurants and shops all over paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than lou@@ is xi@@ v even had .
and the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any dig@@ ging to get roots .
you also see se@@ ash@@ ells -- as discovered by a team here in oxford -- moving 1@@ 25 miles in@@ land from the medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an in al@@ geria .
the president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
ma@@ tt ri@@ d@@ ley : when ideas have sex
one out of four people , one out of four humans in prison are americans , im@@ pris@@ oned in our country .
we just dis@@ miss it out of our consciousness .
our cultural joy , our national joy is nowhere to be seen .
this is a pic@@ or@@ na@@ virus .
here &apos;s the section on the all-@@ important emergency stop switch .
all right , i can see a r@@ hin@@ o@@ virus -- and here &apos;s the blo@@ w-@@ up of the r@@ hin@@ o@@ virus &apos;s little bar@@ code -- but what about different r@@ hin@@ o@@ viruses ?
actually , we thought the nas@@ al tra@@ ct might be full of viruses even when you &apos;re walking around healthy .
if , for example , you used a cell culture that &apos;s chron@@ ically infected with pa@@ pill@@ oma , you get a little computer read@@ out here , and our algorith@@ m says it &apos;s probably pa@@ pill@@ oma type 18 .
they have their own tests , of course , and so they tested her for over 70 different as@@ says , for every sort of bacteria and fun@@ gu@@ s and viral as@@ say you can buy off the shel@@ f : s@@ ars , meta@@ p@@ neu@@ mo@@ virus , hiv , r@@ s@@ v -- all these .
and we know who &apos;s got defe@@ cts in r@@ nas@@ el and who doesn &apos;t .
this is a collaboration between myself and don .
perhaps over@@ looked , vol@@ ta &apos;s invention of the battery for the first time also demon@@ strated the utili@@ ty of a professor .
it &apos;s fit@@ ted with solid electro@@ des and an electro@@ ly@@ te that &apos;s a solution of salt and water .
and this forces mag@@ nes@@ ium to de-@@ allo@@ y and return to the upper electro@@ de , re@@ stor@@ ing the initial constit@@ ution of the battery .
the technology was pro@@ ving itself to be robust and sc@@ al@@ able .
in a battery , i stri@@ ve to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze electrical potential ; when ment@@ oring , i stri@@ ve to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze human potential .
what we &apos;ve built isn &apos;t unique .
what can we discover when there &apos;s thousands of these devices ro@@ aming the seas ?
and another thing that really impres@@ sed me a long time ago was &quot; powers of ten , &quot; charles and ray e@@ ames &apos; film .
i can also inf@@ late or def@@ late it with the mouse wheel , so you sc@@ ul@@ pt it like clay . we have parts here that i can put on or pull off .
so that &apos;s kind of what these tools are about , are : how do we make the game play the player &apos;s imagin@@ ation@@ -@@ am@@ pli@@ fi@@ er ?
so at first they &apos;ll go up , and then they &apos;ll ev@@ apo@@ rate , and that &apos;ll be my planet .
if we pull all the way back , we start seeing the entire galaxy here , kind of slowly in motion . and this is another thing where , typically when people present galaxies , it &apos;s always been these very beautiful photos , but they &apos;re always static . and when you actually bring it forward in time and start anima@@ ting it , it &apos;s actually kind of amazing , what a galaxy would look like , fast for@@ war@@ ded .
here they are arri@@ ving at number 10 , and look at this lucky poli@@ ce@@ man gets to shake hands with the president of the united states . oh , and here comes the prime minister of the — ? no .
it &apos;s about opening up . and this is true across the animal kingdom . it &apos;s not just limited to pri@@ mates .
women feel chron@@ ically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising . but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were particip@@ ating , and how well they were particip@@ ating .
but really , power is also about how you react to stress .
so again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
they &apos;re blind to the hypo@@ thesis . they &apos;re blind to the conditions .
it took me four years longer than my peers , and i convinced someone , my ange@@ l ad@@ vis@@ or , sus@@ an fis@@ ke , to take me on , and so i ended up at prin@@ c@@ et@@ on , and i was like , i am not supposed to be here .
tiny t@@ wea@@ ks can lead to big changes .
and yet people are interestingly resi@@ stant to the idea of appl@@ ying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking .
freedom , if you &apos;re from new ham@@ p@@ shi@@ re .
it is , on the one hand , a biological effect , and a very large one .
and that &apos;s what a meme is . it &apos;s an information pac@@ ket with at@@ titude .
a meme can fl@@ our@@ ish in spi@@ te of having a negative impact on genetic fit@@ ness .
we &apos;re a free society , so we let por@@ no@@ graphy and all these things -- we shr@@ u@@ g them off .

conduc@@ tor charles ha@@ z@@ le@@ wood talks about the role of trust in musical leadership -- then shows how it works , as he condu@@ cts the scot@@ tish en@@ se@@ m@@ ble on@@ stage . he also shares cli@@ ps from two musical projects : the opera &quot; u-@@ car@@ men ek@@ ha@@ ye@@ li@@ t@@ sh@@ a &quot; and the para@@ orchestra .
and because we had a good business model , we actually did it , and i watched these women transform on a micro-@@ level .
where we typically work , there &apos;s people making between one and three dollars a day .
malaria is a disease that kill@@ s one to three million people a year .
and so i want you to meet jac@@ qu@@ eline , my nam@@ es@@ a@@ ke , 21 years old .
to the first son , he left half the cam@@ els .
and it &apos;s a big family re@@ union , and yet , like many family re@@ uni@@ ons , it &apos;s not all peace and light .
because if you think about it , normally when we think of conflict , when we describe it , there &apos;s always two sides -- it &apos;s arab@@ s versus israeli@@ s , labor versus management , husband versus wife , republi@@ cans versus demo@@ cr@@ ats .
the conversation got back on track .
let &apos;s see if we can apply the third side to it .
they need to be able to live the story . how would you do that ?
so effectively , we went from wom@@ b to tom@@ b .
he said it was like a light that went on in our lives .

i hear some &quot; a@@ w &quot; s and i hear some &quot; a@@ ah . &quot;
by the evening of the first day , a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning .
the people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution .
and the doctor of flies very quickly determined that there was one fly that carried the bug .
solution : take human waste , take animal waste , put it into a cham@@ ber , out of that extract bi@@ og@@ as , methan@@ e gas .
paul ph@@ ol@@ er@@ os : how to reduce poverty ? fix homes
just quick re@@ fres@@ her , it &apos;s d-@@ y-@@ k-@@ e .
our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us .
and it starts with three people .
and those are my hei@@ r@@ lo@@ om students making hei@@ r@@ lo@@ om sauce , with plastic for@@ ks , and we get it into the caf@@ e@@ teri@@ a , and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers .
really schol@@ a@@ stic , if you ask me .
but more importantly is my kids learned to get , they learned to give .
thank god o@@ mar knows that car@@ ro@@ ts come from the ground , and not ais@@ le 9 at the super@@ market or through a bul@@ le@@ t-@@ proof window or through a piece of sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am .
we take orders now . i &apos;m boo@@ king for the spring .
and most importantly , get the biggest bul@@ ly out of schools .
we are growing our way into a new economy .
and what we tried with the pig was ex@@ ternal electro@@ des on the skin , like you see in an emergency room , and i &apos;m going to show you why they don &apos;t work very well .
tonight you &apos;ll see some of our invented st@@ ents .
we &apos;ve called the am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce . the am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce is on the way .
eye@@ witness news reporter st@@ acy sa@@ ger tonight , with a small and port@@ able machine that literally zap@@ s your migra@@ ines away .
form a company to develop a neuro@@ -@@ pac@@ e@@ maker for epi@@ le@@ p@@ sy , as well as other diseases of the brain , because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical mal@@ function in it , that causes many , if not all , of brain disorders .
if the electrical signals create a brain disorder , electro@@ -@@ stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain &apos;s neurons .
that &apos;s the present system . how about making a video ?
but then we decided we needed to do something more .
on the ground and around the world people are still curious , and trying to figure out what is going on . but they don &apos;t know .
in the last two years of his life , when he was sick , he filled a not@@ e@@ book with his thoughts about me .
i &apos;m rich bar@@ ani@@ u@@ k .
ok , everybody imagine books and imagine just te@@ aring out the pages .
ok , what about people who are mix@@ ing ? what does &quot; mix@@ ing &quot; mean ?
because it &apos;s published on demand and it &apos;s developed from this re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of open materials .
and the thing that i realized is there was no way that i , as an engineer , could write this book that would get all of this across .
in fact , you &apos;re free to share it , to do all of these things , to copy it , to change it , even to make commercial use of it as long as you attribu@@ te the author .
there &apos;s only one other person here , i think , who did that .
it didn &apos;t scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries , and learning pretty quickly that these kids -- even though english wasn &apos;t their language , the latin alphab@@ et barely was their language , but they could just swim like fish ; they could play these like pian@@ os .
and this particular manufac@@ tur@@ er said , &quot; well , you know , we &apos;re not interested in that . we &apos;re interested in the living room .
now the display on your laptop costs , in r@@ ough numbers , 10 dollars a diag@@ onal inch .
and whether you man@@ ually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen .
seven countries .
the gray market &apos;s a big issue . and one of the ways -- just one -- but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so u@@ tter@@ ly unique .
well , on dec@@ ember 12 , a company called quant@@ a agreed to build it , and since they make about one-@@ third of all the laptops on the planet today , that question disappeared .
but now what we &apos;re looking at is not an exten@@ sion of the physical self , but an exten@@ sion of the mental self , and because of that , we &apos;re able to travel faster , communicate differently .
and i said , &quot; dad , dad , dad , how do you do that ? &quot;
it &apos;s not that we &apos;re always connected to everybody , but at any@@ time we can connect to anyone we want .
am@@ ber case : we are all cy@@ bor@@ gs now
i think there &apos;s an assu@@ mption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is hiv-@@ positive , she &apos;s going to infe@@ ct her child .
and so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes .
we &apos;re all hiv-@@ positive .
our organization has three goals .
and it &apos;s important about dis@@ clo@@ sure .
and the issue in africa is that there are fewer nurses , really than doctors , and so we need to find new paradigm for health care .
that is 20 percent of the global hiv-@@ positive pregnant women -- 20 percent of the world .
so this is a model of the human brain , and this is pre@@ frontal cortex , right at the front .
the director , standing behind the set of shel@@ ves , is going to direct you to move objects around , but remember , he &apos;s not going to ask you to move objects that he can &apos;t see . this introdu@@ ces a really interesting condition where@@ by there &apos;s a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director &apos;s perspective .
so for example , take ris@@ k-@@ taking . we know that adoles@@ cents have a tenden@@ cy to take risks . they do .
so i couldn &apos;t wait to get started to work on this so i could introduce kevin to my robot .
he said , &quot; is the robot real ? &quot;
but that night , as we were pac@@ king up , i asked the tel@@ e-@@ actor , how did the tel@@ e-@@ direc@@ tors decide that they would give a k@@ iss to sam don@@ al@@ d@@ son ?
so we record all these examples , the data , and then we go through a sequence of steps .
thank you .
or , people are not people without other people .
so we took them up to his house , and this visit of the philanthrop@@ ist to his house co@@ inci@@ ded with a time when sol@@ ly &apos;s wife , who was learning english , was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying , &quot; hello , i love you .
the bone is cra@@ cked .
in fact , sol@@ ly gave her the name el@@ vis because he said she walked like she was doing the el@@ vis the pel@@ vis dance .
and it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet .
he said , if ma@@ e west can be m-@@ a-@@ e , why can &apos;t k@@ es@@ ha@@ va be k-@@ a-@@ e ?
but of course i continued creating art@@ work that was honest and raw , because i for@@ got about how people re@@ ac@@ ted to my work .
maybe we are the first to even ac@@ tively record our lives .
i was so inspired .
it seems to me like corpo@@ rations are always trying to get kids , like me , to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn &apos;t good for us or the planet .
so i ask myself , how can i change ? how can i change these things ?
so next time you &apos;re at the gro@@ cer@@ y store , think local , choose organic , know your farmer and know your food .
but before i do , i just want you to pon@@ der this graph for a moment .
the average dep@@ ths are about 12@@ ,000 ft .
the pe@@ aks that don &apos;t come out of the water are the se@@ amounts .
but back to the phoeni@@ x islands , which is the subject of this talk .
i went back to the states and started looking around to see if i could find examples where reverse fishing licen@@ ses had been issu@@ ed , and it turned out there were none .
well , the good news is it &apos;s re@@ covered and reco@@ vering fast , faster than any reef we &apos;ve seen .
here &apos;s the pacific with large mp@@ as and large conservation z@@ ones on it .
the problem is , i don &apos;t think these proje@@ ctions are accurate .
but they &apos;re getting better quite quickly , and dar@@ pa , which is the investment arm of the defense department , is trying to acceler@@ ate their trajec@@ tory .
let me give you a couple examples .
i &apos;m going to leave the last word to a guy who had a front row seat for digital progress , our old friend ken jen@@ n@@ ings . i &apos;m with him .
there &apos;s one from a consumer &apos;s point of view -- where i was happy while experi@@ encing design .
and the theory was that if you abstract an image , you really , you know open as much room for the un-@@ represent@@ able -- and , therefore , you know , are able to invol@@ ve the vie@@ wer more .
i mean , that &apos;s , at least , how it made me happy .
je@@ e gets to have his project ; the public gets a s@@ wee@@ ter environment ; and different public gets a place to express itself ; and the ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ers finally get somebody to look at their ads .
this is : &quot; having &quot; -- this is the same thing ; it &apos;s just , you know , photographed from the side .
it happens mainly under two conditions .
their use@@ ful@@ ness var@@ ies and contribu@@ tes to variation in the society &apos;s treatment of the el@@ derly .
h@@ ence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their you@@ th .
for example , only americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression , the experience of living through a world war , and ag@@ oni@@ zing whether or not dro@@ pping atom@@ ic bom@@ bs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dro@@ pping atom@@ ic bom@@ bs .
they almost never die of diabetes , heart disease , stro@@ ke , and the other non@@ communic@@ able diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today .
the 99 refer@@ ences the 99 attribu@@ tes of al@@ la@@ h in the koran , things like gener@@ osity and mer@@ cy and for@@ es@@ ight and wisdom and do@@ zens of others that no two people in the world would dis@@ agree about .
to which he said , &quot; let them be , because what they &apos;re giving us is worth a lot more than what we &apos;re paying them . &quot;
and the s@@ wis@@ s psycho@@ analy@@ st , carl jung , also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures , so i figure i &apos;m covered .
so from day one , the people involved in the project , bottom left is fab@@ ian ni@@ c@@ ie@@ za , writer for x-@@ men and power ran@@ gers .
the bad news is they were all photo@@ cop@@ ies , so we didn &apos;t make a di@@ me in reven@@ ue .
you are no@@ ora the light .
i left bel@@ le@@ v@@ ue , went to business school and started this .
and what ra@@ yan did then is he sat there , he ta@@ pped his foot on the floor , at three and a half , and he looked at me and he said , &quot; bab@@ a , i want you to come with me to my office in my house .
so , let &apos;s see .
so , by visu@@ alizing this information , we turned it into a landscape that you can explore with your eyes , a kind of map really , a sort of information map .
well , november , christmas video games come out , and there may well be an up@@ sur@@ ge in the concern about their content .
you might want to get some chocolate in .
i feel that everyday , all of us now are being bla@@ sted by information design .
it &apos;s got to be america , right ?
so , absolute figures , like the military budget , in a connected world , don &apos;t give you the whole picture .
so it spa@@ w@@ ns itself .
so , just to wra@@ p up , i wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions , and information design is about solving information problems .
the l@@ ush heart note , mel@@ al@@ eu@@ ca bar@@ k note -- which does not con@@ tain any mel@@ al@@ eu@@ ca bar@@ k , because it &apos;s totally for@@ bi@@ dden .
why doesn &apos;t it smell of po@@ tat@@ oes or vio@@ lets ? well , there are really two theor@@ ies .
a theory is something that en@@ ables you to do less work .
now , after searching high and low for several months , i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a bor@@ ane which has exactly the same vibra@@ tion .
ok . now . if something absor@@ bs the energy , the electr@@ on can travel .
and we actually , in this case , i &apos;m sorry to say , it happened -- it was ser@@ en@@ di@@ pit@@ ous .
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achie@@ ving clar@@ ity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications .
each year , one in 10 tax@@ pa@@ yers recei@@ ves a notice from the irs .
harry po@@ tter was a fo@@ ster child .
a little break .
and it turns out i &apos;ve got the de@@ vil inside of me .
by the way , years later , my social worker said that i should never have been put in there .
i don &apos;t mean children . i mean the child of the state .
i doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that &apos;s in this picture , but if you look very carefully , there is a ja@@ w , a lower ja@@ w , of a 4@@ .@@ 1-@@ milli@@ on-@@ year-old u@@ pri@@ ght-@@ walking ap@@ e as it was found at lake tur@@ kan@@ a on the west side .
and we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains , and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story .
unfortunately for him , he fell into a sw@@ amp and couldn &apos;t get out .
is this a good evolutionary adap@@ tation , or is it going to lead us to being the shor@@ te@@ st-@@ lived hom@@ in@@ id species on planet earth ?
we could tell every single human being out there , if we really wanted to .
russi@@ an nuclear launch key : the one on the top is the picture of the one i found on e@@ bay ; the one on the bottom is the one i made for myself , because i couldn &apos;t afford the one on e@@ bay .
this is the kind of accu@@ racy that i wanted , and i repli@@ cated every last bone and put it in .
i found other reference . a@@ v@@ i &#91; ara &#93; che@@ k@@ may@@ an , a new jer@@ sey edi@@ tor , actually found this res@@ in mal@@ t@@ ese fal@@ con at a fle@@ a market in 199@@ 1 , although it took him five years to auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ate this bird to the au@@ c@@ tion@@ e@@ ers &apos; speci@@ fi@@ cations , because there was a lot of contro@@ ver@@ sy about it .
terri@@ fying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer of the black da@@ h@@ li@@ a .
on the far left is a piece of cra@@ p -- a repli@@ ca i bought on e@@ bay .
i &apos;d been hit by a spee@@ ding utili@@ ty truck with only 10 minutes to go on the bike ride .
it was the fight of my life .
and the question i asked myself is , if i couldn &apos;t do that , then who was i ?
and i said , &quot; not me , not jan@@ ine the machine , &quot; which was my ni@@ ck@@ name .
and i realized that this wasn &apos;t just my life .
i &apos;m holding on to the counter because i can &apos;t stand .
didn &apos;t know how on earth i &apos;d ever pass a medical .
it wasn &apos;t until i let go of the life i thought i should have that i was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me .
i &apos;m not a scientist . i could have been , perhaps , but i work in this world where i trust my instin@@ cts .
that is like an an@@ ish ka@@ poor flo@@ wing through a richard ser@@ ra .
how the hell do i do a telephone in three weeks , when you get these things that take hundreds of million years to evolve ?
any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object .
if he was a car designer , p@@ he@@ w , we &apos;d all be driving one .
this is some current work i &apos;m doing .
that is an image of a car for me .
can you imagine ? a car on a stick .
yeah , and it has an internal hand@@ ra@@ il which gives it it &apos;s strength . it &apos;s this holi@@ stic integration .
lots of stuff . there &apos;s a little lea@@ f chair -- that golden looking thing is called &quot; lea@@ f . &quot;
it was actually developed for use by the off@@ shore oil industry for diving on oil ri@@ gs down to a depth of 2,000 feet .
but i started to realize that i could actually identify animals by the type of flash@@ es they produced .
this fish actually has high be@@ ams .
he has no l@@ ure for attra@@ cting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there .
that &apos;s not l@@ umines@@ cence , that &apos;s refle@@ cted light from the gon@@ ads .
and you can see just what a sho@@ e@@ string operation this really was , because we cast these 16 blue le@@ ds in e@@ po@@ x@@ y and you can see in the e@@ po@@ x@@ y m@@ old that we used , the word zi@@ plo@@ c is still visible .
i promise , you &apos;ll love it .
while all the brothers were busy just being hyper@@ -@@ connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the ic@@ e@@ berg , because she would have wo@@ ken up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f@@ - or ei@@ ght-@@ hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
homo@@ sexual ne@@ cro@@ phili@@ a .
and there are nine other w@@ inn@@ ers who get pri@@ zes .
it &apos;s remarkable : the position .
in the u.s. alone , a billion birds die in colli@@ sion with glass buildings .
it &apos;s when i started to feel that the cyber@@ ne@@ tic device was no longer a device .
some people , i would never relate , but they sound similar .
i can hear if someone points at me with a remote control .
and our guide was a local science teacher .
the case went on for two years ; i think he &apos;s still appe@@ aling the case .
well , the healthcare system has been transformed : a culture per@@ v@@ aded with defen@@ si@@ veness , universal di@@ str@@ ust of the system of justice , universal practice of defen@@ sive medicine .
and how has this system of law worked for government ?
but the challenge here is not one of just am@@ ending the law , because the hur@@ d@@ le for success is trust .
those di@@ kes have bur@@ st . people wa@@ de through law all day long .
as you &apos;re going down , and walking down the side@@ walk during the day , you have to think that if there is a dis@@ pu@@ te , there &apos;s somebody in society who sees it as their job to aff@@ ir@@ mati@@ vely protect you if you &apos;re acting reas@@ on@@ ably .
what the world needs now is to re@@ store the authority to make common choices .
more and more rules to protect us against an in@@ different , un@@ car@@ ing set of institutions we have to deal with .
so one example is he sees these st@@ one@@ ma@@ sons working on the is@@ le of les@@ bo@@ s , and they need to measure out round colum@@ ns .
michael &apos;s a young guy .
and he asked for the mand@@ atory minim@@ um sentence for ar@@ med rob@@ ber@@ y .
people have to make a living .
so these are little ordinary , everyday heroes , and they &apos;re incredibly ad@@ mir@@ able , but there &apos;s no way that they can susta@@ in this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or gr@@ in@@ ds them down .
stayed with them , followed up on them , made sure that they were sti@@ cking to whatever plan had been jo@@ in@@ tly developed to get them over the hum@@ p .
we &apos;ll see .
and i would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atom@@ ic weapon@@ ry , until this very moment , we &apos;ve actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that &apos;s characteri@@ zed by two ph@@ ases , which i &apos;m going to go through with you right now .
and the danger of that , of course , is that a mis@@ reading of a ra@@ dar screen could actually cause a counter@@ -@@ launch , even though the first country had not actually launched anything .
they would pro@@ pose -- actually there were about six vol@@ um@@ es written on this -- a crisis rel@@ oc@@ ation plan that was dependent upon the united states having three to four days war@@ ning that the so@@ vie@@ ts were going to attack us .
and it &apos;s particularly not secure in the former soviet union , now in russia .
well , what we &apos;re seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized .
you don &apos;t want to build a su@@ it@@ case bomb , and you happen to get one of those inse@@ cure nuclear war@@ heads that exist .
so if there &apos;s any way that you can avoid , like , a@@ ver@@ t your eyes , that would be a good thing .
and the far@@ ther you are away in distance , the longer it is in time from the initial bl@@ ast ; and the more separ@@ ation between you and the outside atmosphere , the better .
we &apos;ve been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades .
enormous innovation , enormous energy , enormous talent now has been mobili@@ zed through this structure to try to deal with all of these challenges .
and that &apos;s really clear now .
the solution becomes self-@@ susta@@ ining .
but the more deeply i got into all these social issues , one after another , and actually , the more i tried to address them myself , personally , in a few cases , through non@@ prof@@ its that i was involved with , the more i found actually that the reality is the opposite .
this is a company that &apos;s brought dri@@ p irri@@ gation technology to thousands and millions of farmers , re@@ ducing substan@@ tially the use of water .
young people , i think , my harvard business school students , are getting it .
right there .
just like this , students can isol@@ ate anybody and dis@@ se@@ ct any way you want to .
the members of the association are sho@@ cked to realize that it &apos;s the poet sam@@ u@@ el ta@@ yl@@ or col@@ eri@@ dge , who hadn &apos;t even left his house in years until that day .
in the cambridge winter of 18@@ 12 and 18@@ 13 , the four met for what they called philosop@@ hi@@ cal break@@ fa@@ sts .
i mean , this n@@ au@@ tical al@@ mana@@ c published the lun@@ ar differences for every month of the year .
that &apos;s the hero@@ ic part of their story .
but it was an exciting experience .
except , if you look a little bit closer , you see , in fact , that this thing is way too small to be anything like that .
but the interesting thing about these computer virus infe@@ ctions was that , if you look at the rate at which the infe@@ ction worked , they show this spi@@ ky behavior that you &apos;re used to from a flu virus .
and all different stra@@ ins are color@@ ed in different colors .
so here would be a frequency plot of how often you find each of the 26 letters of the alphab@@ et in a text written by random monkeys .
so this also turns out to be extremely robust .
and indeed , we &apos;re going to be dro@@ pping these guys into that sou@@ p all the time .
life can be less mysteri@@ ous than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other planets .
it &apos;s kind of on its way out now , but we still use it for 99 percent of our stuff .
sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer , and sometimes , actually not in@@ frequ@@ ently , it actually never happens .
while i was doing it , my business partner , rose , who &apos;s here with her husband , mat@@ the@@ w , here in the audience , rose was out doing similar stuff for the american red cross .
but the miracle that happened , i &apos;m going to call it hot@@ mail for short .
it &apos;s clou@@ d-@@ based , and it doesn &apos;t require any training , progra@@ mming , consu@@ l@@ tan@@ ts .
jo@@ el sel@@ ani@@ ki@@ o : the surprising seeds of a big@@ -@@ data revolution in healthcare
well , in a balloon it &apos;s easy , we have ball@@ ast .
and that we can a@@ im for much higher spiritu@@ ality if we get rid of the religious do@@ g@@ mas .
we slo@@ wed down . and we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel 4@@ 5,000 kilometers .
it allowed to do all those things there .
6@@ 4 meter w@@ ing@@ sp@@ an to carry one pilot , the batter@@ ies , flies slowly enough with the aero@@ dynamic efficiency .
and there , there will be just one goal , just one : reach the next sun@@ rise before the batter@@ ies are empty .
you can just go on solar@@ impul@@ se@@ .com , sub@@ scri@@ be to just be in@@ formed of what we &apos;re doing .
what turns me on about the digital age , what exc@@ ites me personally , is that you have closed the gap between dre@@ aming and doing .
they called me , &quot; the girl with the be@@ ard . &quot;
the right to live , period .
we &apos;re standing around with wat@@ ering cans , when what we really need is the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
and that might be smart in these nervous , dangerous times .
and because we can , we must .
economists con@@ firm it , and they know much more than i do .
this could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet earth .
as i say , there &apos;re two things on the line here .
i believe it &apos;s possible .
we need to get the math ; we need to get the statistics out to the american people .
i think it &apos;s possible .
i am , of course , refer@@ ring to none other than el@@ vis pres@@ ley .
now , syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia is the experience of a stimul@@ us in once sense organ in another sense organ as well , such as color@@ ed hearing .

and i gave up salt , i went v@@ eg@@ an , and i started taking huge do@@ ses of sil@@ den@@ a@@ fi@@ l , also known as vi@@ agr@@ a .
he was a big figure in all of our lives , and we loved him very much .
i per@@ formed here and there , but as my condition de@@ teri@@ or@@ ated , so did my voice .
i flew to cle@@ vel@@ and , and my family rus@@ hed there in hop@@ es that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final good@@ b@@ ye .
it &apos;s about living .
one is that you and i all have between 30 to 50,000 chemicals in our bodies that our grand@@ parents didn &apos;t have .
in some cases , another species like the north american leop@@ ard frog showed that males exposed to at@@ ra@@ zine grew eggs in their te@@ stes .
and for those of you who are not parents , si@@ pp@@ y cu@@ ps are those little plastic things that your child gradu@@ ates to after using bot@@ tles .
and this is not just philosop@@ hi@@ cal , it &apos;s already known , that chemicals like di@@ eth@@ yl@@ st@@ il@@ be@@ stro@@ l and est@@ ro@@ gen , p@@ c@@ bs , dd@@ t cross the plac@@ ent@@ a and effectively determine and obesity and diabetes already when the baby &apos;s in the wom@@ b .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s just profound and sad , but astonishing because so many of us don &apos;t actually know this .
we know what we &apos;re putting out there , we have a sense of those re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ sions , but we are so ignor@@ ant of this sense of what happens when we put things , or things are put into our bodies .
we use two million of them in the united states every five minutes , here ima@@ ged by ted pres@@ enter chris j@@ ord@@ an , who art@@ fully docum@@ ents mass consumption and zo@@ oms in for more detail .
i thought i would spend 20 bucks .
now , the market can do a lot for us , but it can &apos;t fix the natural system in the ocean we &apos;ve broken .
even so , about four percent of the pri@@ me@@ val red@@ wood rain@@ forest remains in@@ t@@ act , wild and now protected -- entirely protected -- in a chain of small parks str@@ ung out like pe@@ ar@@ ls along the north coast of california , including red@@ wood national park .
that is to say , at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the bran@@ ches of red@@ wood trees .
it became a writing project .
now , here we see a rei@@ ter@@ ation in chron@@ os , one of the older red@@ woods .
they &apos;ve wired them like patients in an ic@@ u .
one of the things that is just -- i almost can &apos;t concei@@ ve it -- is the idea that the national news media hasn &apos;t picked this up at all , and this is the deva@@ station of one of the most important ecosystems in north america .
but l@@ ately , the doors of the pal@@ ace have been fl@@ ung open , and the walls are coming down .
that &apos;s 25 years ago .
for example , let &apos;s go with the centi@@ pe@@ de virus first .
so how do these guys then mon@@ eti@@ ze those infected computers ?
and they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security pre@@ cau@@ tions we can build .
you &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a web address : uni@@ on@@ see@@ k@@ .com / d / i@@ o@@ o@@ .@@ ex@@ e and when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to down@@ load and run that program .
and if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the mer@@ ce@@ des is o@@ 6@@ 00@@ ko@@ 7@@ 8@@ rus .
we must have some way of continu@@ ing to work even if computers fail .
now before i get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising , because i &apos;m not engaged in the business of magic .
if you &apos;re trying to influence corpo@@ rations to change their behavior , with reg@@ ard to producing pollu@@ tan@@ ts , one approach , the common approach , is to ex@@ h@@ ort them to be better , to explain to them what damage they &apos;re doing to the planet .
to 1,@@ 200 ? no .
so with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have , what the chan@@ ces are that they &apos;re willing to take , what they &apos;re after , what they value , what they want , and what they believe about other people .
it would achieve some national pri@@ de , but not go ahead and build a weapon .
ok , so i &apos;d like you to take a little away from this .
so , if you &apos;re in the audience today , or maybe you &apos;re watching this talk in some other time or place , you are a particip@@ ant in the digital rights ecosystem .
well , most rights ow@@ ners , instead of blo@@ cking , will allow the copy to be published .
it &apos;s not un@@ common for a single video to have multiple rights ow@@ ners .
the smo@@ oth st@@ ones on the sand are familiar to us .
i &apos;m on a remote island in mi@@ cr@@ on@@ es@@ ia .
the wisdom of these el@@ ders is not a m@@ ere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot .
true navi@@ gation begins in the human heart .
but we all know that that &apos;s bu@@ ll@@ sh@@ it at times .
and the reason is , it &apos;s about appreci@@ ation and it &apos;s about contribu@@ tion . you can only feel so much by yourself .
and you correct me if i &apos;m wrong .
and that sounds really heavy , but in the last five or 10 years , 15 years , how have there been some decisions you &apos;ve made that if you &apos;d made a different decision , your life would be completely different ? how many can think about it ?
your model of the world is what shapes you long term .
we need variety . we need surprise .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s true -- we need it . we can do it through inti@@ macy , through friend@@ ship , through pra@@ yer , through walking in nature .
i got my friends involved and i grew companies and then i got 11 companies and i built the foundation .
he said , &quot; if you leave and go to that hawaii thing , it &apos;s over with us . &quot;
i &apos;ve been playing ted for nearly a decade , and i &apos;ve very rarely played any new songs of my own .
you know , as i look around the world i see a lot of gap@@ s , and i think we all see a lot of gap@@ s .
the diam@@ eter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside , so that the large dots con@@ tain large sent@@ ences , and the small dots con@@ tain small sent@@ ences .
these are automatically constructed using the found objects : &quot; i think i feel a little full . &quot;
you can see the little pink cur@@ sor moving along , repres@@ enting our position .
you can si@@ ft through this data and see what people have sub@@ mit@@ ted .
nobody &apos;s seen this yet , publi@@ c@@ ly .
we can isol@@ ate just the photographs , and we now see those .
so if i put in climate change for all of 2006 , we &apos;ll see what that universe looks like .
it seems like they &apos;re everyone &apos;s de@@ fault do@@ om@@ -@@ and-@@ glo@@ om metaphor .
what would that mean ?
this looks like a series of breaking waves , and it &apos;s caused by she@@ aring win@@ ds -- the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer diff@@ er signific@@ antly , and in the middle , in between , you get this und@@ ul@@ ating of the air , and if the difference in those spee@@ ds is just right , the tops of the un@@ du@@ lations cur@@ l over in these beautiful breaking wa@@ ve-@@ like vor@@ tic@@ es .
the shar@@ p , cris@@ p out@@ lines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in .
let &apos;s go back a few years in time and see what happened back then .
using computers , even though they &apos;re getting faster and better all the time , it &apos;s a challenge to deal with gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of data , ter@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of data and extra@@ cting the relevant information .
you can see that there is &#91; a &#93; sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ing of x-@@ rays on the teeth , the metal in the teeth .
and again , it &apos;s fully interactive , so you can ro@@ tate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .
it really just works like a huge iphone .
and to take that even further , this is a heart .
so mot@@ ts is doing something here , and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activ@@ ated on the motor cortex .
i can pe@@ el off the layer of the lion .
and so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreci@@ ated both those sides .
he said , &quot; ok . i measured the height of a bri@@ ck .
the standard explanation is that the universe somehow spr@@ ang into existence , full of a strange kind of energy -- in@@ fla@@ tionary energy -- which ble@@ w it up .
the density of matter is fin@@ ite , and we have a chance of a consi@@ stent set of equ@@ ations that can describe the whole process .
and the next map now shows africa &apos;s gdp in 1960 , around the time of indepen@@ dence for many african states .
and to my aston@@ ish@@ ment , they bac@@ ked me 100 percent .
everyone lives together in this hotel -- lec@@ tur@@ ers and students -- and it &apos;s not surprising at all to find an impro@@ mp@@ tu tu@@ tor@@ ial at 1 a.@@ m.
i will be atten@@ ding a@@ ims .
i want to point out a few other ex@@ cep@@ tional people in this picture .
and our partners across africa are extremely enthusi@@ a@@ stic about this .
when computers were first introduced , they were said to be a million times faster than neurons .
and let me just sum@@ mar@@ ize . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
now , what &apos;s happening is that as transi@@ stors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller , they no longer behave like this .
ok , so a computer pi@@ cks a specific it@@ em of data from memory , it sen@@ ds it into the process@@ or or the al@@ u , and then it puts the result back into memory .
this is kar@@ e@@ em &apos;s dark eyes and that &apos;s the white background that you see here .
and i think a lot of people in africa have this different perspective , and i think that &apos;s going to impact technology .
so , this is a little tri@@ cky .
and since the mass determin@@ es the schwarz@@ schild radi@@ us , there is actually only one thing i really need to know .
and yet , what we actually see is light that can &apos;t be explained by the star@@ light .
and the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole .
so , without this technology you can &apos;t see the stars .
to give you a sense of how small that size is , that &apos;s the size of our solar system .
so , you shouldn &apos;t see young stars .
and this means that these things do exist in our universe , and we have to con@@ tend with this , we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world .
one day in new york , i was on the street and i saw some kids playing baseball between sto@@ ops and cars and fire hy@@ dr@@ ants .
and the way we react to them has changed radi@@ cally over the centuries , as have our pre@@ fer@@ ences for them .
and every musical era had different pri@@ orities of these things , different things to pass on , different &apos; what@@ s &apos; and &apos; ho@@ ws &apos; .
and the effects of technology began to be felt also , because printing put music , the sc@@ ores , the co@@ de@@ books of music , into the hands of per@@ form@@ ers everywhere .
what &apos;s the long-term effect of this on us or on music ?
you don &apos;t need to worry about knowing anything .
so tur@@ bin@@ es grew . and they can now sp@@ an up to three hundred feet at the hu@@ b height , but they can &apos;t really go a lot higher , and more height is where the more wind is , and more power -- as much as twice as much .
and the spru@@ ce goo@@ se would be a 15@@ -@@ mega@@ watt wing .
but he wrote that for his wife .
and another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind , because i don &apos;t -- i &apos;m one of those teenagers that are really easily di@@ stra@@ cted , so if i &apos;m trying to do home@@ work , if i &apos;m trying to do home@@ work and i don &apos;t feel like it , i &apos;ll try to draw or , you know , waste my time .
i &apos;m going to try to put that in some sort of order .
and so j@@ on had a brilliant idea : he went out to rec@@ ru@@ it the best of the best dan@@ cers off of youtube to create this dance trou@@ pe -- the lea@@ gue of extraordinary dan@@ cers , the l@@ x@@ d .
ab@@ sent desire , not going to happen .
and , very happ@@ ily , there &apos;s one class of people who really can &apos;t make use of this tool .
and that &apos;s why what i &apos;m excited about , and what i think is under@@ -@@ reported , is the signifi@@ can@@ ce of the rise of online video .
it can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to repli@@ cate the experiments that are described in print .
the world &apos;s ambi@@ tious innov@@ ators and influ@@ en@@ cers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide , and so the art of the spoken word pretty much with@@ ered on the vine .
we can &apos;t stop learning at age 21 .
we have our own film school .
so if you came here to talk about how french coffee will spread happiness in our brains , that &apos;s a go .
slides are okay , though you might consider going for pro@@ ps .
but before i do that , let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible .
here &apos;s the key feature though . these neurons are also involved in the way you can as@@ sign value to literally abstract ideas , and i put some sym@@ b@@ ols up here that we as@@ sign value to for various reasons .
one area is called experiment@@ al economics . the other area is called behavioral economics .
when methan@@ e built up , or carbon dioxide built up , or oxygen was di@@ min@@ ished , the birds would s@@ wo@@ on before people would -- so it ac@@ ted as an early war@@ ning system : hey , get out of the mine . things aren &apos;t going so well .
mice , bu@@ gs and ham@@ sters are no longer the only way to study the brain . functional mri allows scientists to map brain activity in living , breathing , decisi@@ on-@@ making human beings . read mon@@ ta@@ gue gives an over@@ view of how this technology is helping us understand the complicated ways in which we interact with each other .
now , if you combine this very simple , very conserva@@ tive thought -- go with the grain of human nature -- with all the advan@@ ces in behavioral economics , some of which we were just hearing about , again , i think we can achieve a real increase in well-being , in happiness , in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money .
so we &apos;re now living in a post-@@ bure@@ au@@ cra@@ tic age , where genu@@ ine people power is possible .
you can see what crime is committed where , and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account .
but when he made that speech , what could you do to build the stronger , better society ?
how would i know what i was doing differently ?
in fact , there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary ga@@ ins .
i just have a flip camera and a little tri@@ po@@ d and invest@@ ed in this tiny little wi@@ de-@@ angle lens .
building this system will also require a consider@@ able investment .
the idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate , it could really stimu@@ late innovation .
we make things grow .
a bio@@ hacker in germany , a journalist , wanted to know whose dog was leaving little pres@@ ents on his street ?
this is such a new area , and as we say back in brooklyn , you ain &apos;t seen no@@ thin &apos; yet .
matters of principle aside , prac@@ tically speaking , these laws drive hiv underground .
the first is nick r@@ ho@@ a@@ des . he &apos;s an american .
they didn &apos;t give the forms to me or explain what was in the form .
but some countries take a harder line on this than others .
we can re@@ tool pris@@ ons so that hiv pre@@ vention and harm reduction is available to prison@@ ers .
then , with industri@@ alization , everything started to become cent@@ r@@ alized .
and increasingly , everything that people buy , every consumer product , in one way or another , can be person@@ alized .
they took the elev@@ ated highway , they got rid of it , they rec@@ la@@ im@@ ed the street , the river down below , below the street , and you can go from one end of se@@ ou@@ l to the other without cros@@ sing a path@@ way for cars .
housing is another area where we can really improve .
we think these little wireless sensors are more effective .
they &apos;re fantastic creatures .
maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year .
and it &apos;s been suggest@@ ed that bas@@ king sharks would make fantastic indi@@ cat@@ ors of climate change , because they &apos;re basically continu@@ ous plan@@ k@@ ton recor@@ ders swimming around with their mouth open .
we use a pole camera on the boat to actually film shark .
one thing that i think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks are .
i don &apos;t understand this . i don &apos;t pre@@ tend to understand this .
and some are caught in nets , in tra@@ w@@ ls .
it was only because we had a conference on the is@@ le of man .
and you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind .
simon ber@@ row : how do you save a shark you know nothing about ?
in their bi@@ ds to kill , i got the police on stand@@ by , and they came that f@@ ateful morning to come and kill the child .
i didn &apos;t u@@ tter a word .
many times , the prison auth@@ orities have den@@ ied ever having issues of drug abuse , issues of so@@ dom@@ y , so many issues they would den@@ y that it ever happens .
a@@ a sure . you know , under@@ cover is all about setting the pri@@ orities right , so we got people to take me to court .
what are you into ? who are you into ?
i kept up the char@@ ade for eight years .
so four , almost five years ago , pro@@ position 8 , the great marriage equ@@ ality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
so i decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mu@@ g@@ shots if you will .
i challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deser@@ ve less than any other human being .
of course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but i found that a much larger propor@@ tion of people identi@@ fied as something that was much more nu@@ an@@ ced .
because i already am all of those things .
and apparently , he dis@@ o@@ be@@ yed god , and that &apos;s the ultimate dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence to authority .
because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera , they took pictures of everything . more than 1,000 .
this is the foundation of all of social science , the foundation of religion , the foundation of war .
people say , &quot; no , that &apos;s na@@ zi germany , that &apos;s hit@@ ler , you know , that &apos;s 193@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; sir , who &apos;s going to be responsible if something happens to him ? &quot;
interestingly , stan@@ ley mil@@ gram and i were in the same high school class in james mon@@ ro@@ e in the bronx , 195@@ 4 .
here are the gu@@ ards with the sym@@ b@@ ols of power and anony@@ mit@@ y .
de@@ human@@ i@@ zation of others . de-@@ individu@@ ation of self .
and since the in@@ quisi@@ tion , we &apos;ve been dealing with problems at the individual level . and you know what ? it doesn &apos;t work .
they &apos;re not prison@@ ers , they &apos;re not gu@@ ards , they &apos;re boys , and you are responsible . &quot;
the train clear@@ ance is 21 inches .
and of course , scott fit@@ z@@ ger@@ ald said fam@@ ously that &quot; he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be bl@@ amed for . &quot;
that flow of mental images is mind .
but some@@ time ago , through the help of an op@@ th@@ am@@ ologist colleague of mine , car@@ men pu@@ li@@ a@@ fi@@ to , who developed a laser scanner of the retin@@ a , i found out the the following .
it &apos;s the following .
but if you consider the green part of the brain stem , nothing like that happens .
that &apos;s where the difference is .
and finally , medicine .
he &apos;s actually here today .
i co-@@ ed@@ it , along with a collective of other super-@@ smart , amazing women , a site called fe@@ mini@@ st@@ ing@@ .@@ com@@ .
it &apos;s enough to make you feel very overwhel@@ med .
but what they managed to do within those systems was be a human@@ i@@ zing force .
some attribu@@ te this golden world knowledge to pla@@ to , others to py@@ th@@ ag@@ or@@ as .
it means we &apos;ve got to get out of here .
and the more focused my brain is , the more the circuit board is going to sur@@ ge with energy .
they followed these little shif@@ ts in your mental activity .
this technology is in@@ tra@@ -@@ active .
when our productivity starts to sl@@ ac@@ ken , we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play .
imagine playing a video game controlled by your mind . now imagine that game also teach@@ es you about your own patterns of stress , rela@@ x@@ ation and focus . ar@@ iel garten shows how looking at our own brain activity gives new meaning to the ancient dic@@ tum &quot; know th@@ y@@ self . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i can &apos;t see this clock and i can &apos;t see the ti@@ ming , so hol@@ y god , woo@@ ho@@ o !
but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face .
and it &apos;s frighten@@ ing , isn &apos;t it ?
i just was so -- how do i tell him ?
because who am i going to be ?
and i grab@@ bed this book off , and i &apos;m sitting on the cou@@ ch going , &quot; i know what i &apos;m going to do .
but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally re@@ frame dis@@ ability in a way that was exciting and possible .
we are extraordinary , different , wonderful people .
if you &apos;re an up@@ per@@ -@@ midd@@ le-@@ class english person , you call un@@ emplo@@ yment &quot; a year off . &quot;
what you call them actually affec@@ ts how you react to them , vis@@ cer@@ ally and mor@@ ally .
what they don &apos;t say is , &quot; well the numbers all seem to add up , but before i present this idea , i &apos;ll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better . &quot;
google understood that if you &apos;re just a search engine , people assume you &apos;re a very , very good search engine .
because they think you &apos;re deli@@ ber@@ ately creating del@@ a@@ ys at the bridge in order to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze your reven@@ ue , and &quot; why on earth should i pay to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze your im@@ compe@@ ten@@ ce ? &quot;
and he used this following analog@@ y .
choose your frame of reference and the percei@@ ved value and therefore the actual value is completely tran@@ formed .
nothing ever turns out as plan@@ ned ... ever .
and like most of you , i suspe@@ ct , i don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future .
the development of lor@@ ca@@ ini@@ de was aband@@ oned for commercial reasons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of publi@@ cation bias .
we were mis@@ led , and this is a syste@@ matic fla@@ w in the core of medicine .
first of all , we had trials regi@@ sters , and everybody said , oh , it &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll get everyone to regi@@ ster their trials , they &apos;ll post the proto@@ co@@ l , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then afterwards we &apos;ll be able to check and see if all the trials which have been condu@@ cted and comple@@ ted have been published .
but what you see here is the result of , actually , intern@@ ships that we ho@@ sted with lin@@ kop@@ ing university in sweden .
we &apos;re actually sharing t@@ ours of the universe with the first sub-@@ sahar@@ an planet@@ arium in ghana as well as new libr@@ aries that have been built in the g@@ he@@ t@@ tos in colum@@ bia and a high school in cam@@ bo@@ dia .
and we started by making instruments for some of the world &apos;s greatest per@@ form@@ ers -- we call these hyper@@ instruments -- for yo@@ -@@ yo ma , peter gab@@ ri@@ el , prin@@ ce , orchestr@@ as , rock b@@ ands . instruments where they &apos;re all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument , so the instrument knows how it &apos;s being played .
music is the best way to re@@ store speech to people who have lost it through stro@@ kes , movement to people with parkin@@ son &apos;s disease .
every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigan@@ tic music instrument , like this chan@@ deli@@ er . it takes up the whole stage . it looks like a chan@@ deli@@ er , but it &apos;s actually a robotic music instrument .
i have always loved music and i am excited to be able to condu@@ ct my own music with this new software .
t@@ m : so let &apos;s do it . so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you &apos;re going to play now ?
and he &apos;s standing on the de@@ ck of his ship , he &apos;s talking to his first mate , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; tomorrow , we will sa@@ il past those rocks , and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called si@@ r@@ ens .
he thro@@ ws the first mate to the ground .
it &apos;s off in the future . it &apos;s weak .
but despite my like for them , there &apos;s two na@@ gging concern@@ s that i &apos;ve always had about commitment devices , and you might feel this if you use them yourself .
and we &apos;re at a situation now where for every three baby boom@@ ers , the m@@ ck@@ inse@@ y global institute predi@@ cts that two will not be able to meet their pre-@@ reti@@ rement needs while they &apos;re in reti@@ rement .
if you &apos;re like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of el@@ ation and joy -- just to think about making 50 percent more money in reti@@ rement than before .
whereas if the present self sa@@ ves a lot , the future self is deli@@ gh@@ ted , where the income is close up near 100 percent .
and i &apos;ll close it there .
this is the letter she@@ en , and it makes the sound we think of as sh -- &quot; sh . &quot;
it might surprise some of you here , as it did me , when i discovered that suicide is at the top of the list of the leading causes of death in young people in all countries in the world , including the poorest countries of the world .
to give you a perspective , if i had to translate the propor@@ tion of psychi@@ atri@@ sts in the population that one might see in britain to india , one might expect roughly 15@@ 0,000 psychi@@ atri@@ sts in india .
just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world assem@@ bled at al@@ ma@@ -@@ at@@ a and made this icon@@ ic dec@@ lar@@ ation .
we were losing it at an extraordinary rate -- in fact , of the order of two to four trillion doll@@ ar@@ s-@@ worth of natural capital .
once again , most of that doesn &apos;t get paid .
see that again .
i think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital .
so in fact , the price of ti@@ mber in the beijing market@@ place ought to have been three-@@ times what it was had it refle@@ cted the true pain and the costs to the society within china .
it &apos;s not doing too well . we &apos;ve over@@ -@@ issu@@ ed .
let &apos;s think about it and what it means , but please , let &apos;s not do more of that .
well , not as big as his , but fairly big .
when he finished the story , i said to him , &quot; dick , i wonder what would be the difference between a feynman sandwich and a sus@@ s@@ kind sandwich . &quot;
but the amazing thing was -- feynman had to leave a little early .
the reason he called me leonardo is because we were in europe and he was practic@@ ing his french .
i don &apos;t know . maybe . who knows ?
the first one was that when helium atoms touch each other , they re@@ pel .
people were trying to do them .
thank you .
what i came up with was a series of second s@@ kins that basically flo@@ at over the al@@ umin@@ um shell .
all the cas@@ e@@ work is hand@@ -@@ scri@@ bed in , uni@@ qu@@ ely , so you can &apos;t just cut 100 parts for 100 tra@@ il@@ ers , you have to cut them big , and every single one is hand@@ -@@ fit .
and what i now present to you is an ex@@ cer@@ pt from a book in progress .
you lay down a couple of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body , keep the bla@@ de shar@@ p , never force it -- and these are things kids can understand and practice with .
techni@@ cally the ri@@ a@@ a can come and per@@ se@@ cute you .
we are all aware of the risk of cancer , but there &apos;s another disease that &apos;s dest@@ ined to affect even more of us : ar@@ thri@@ tis .
and the tissue &apos;s very expensive .
we &apos;re going to res@@ ur@@ face it with a completely new surface .
they would bring them back and mo@@ unt them .
instead of showing an object from the stage i &apos;m going to do something special for the first time .
ted is all about patterns in the clouds .
you see , it takes the energy in one l@@ um@@ p of coal to move one me@@ gab@@ y@@ te of information across the net .
light came out of it in every direction .
you have to be kind of smart , and though i did not graduate from college doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today .
they have literally beat a path to our door .
when you listen to stere@@ o on your home system , your both ears hear both speakers .
looked up at the cei@@ ling of my office one day -- i was working on a gro@@ und@@ -@@ pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ating ra@@ dar project -- and my physicist ce@@ o came in and said , &quot; we have a real problem .
yeah , there you go .
&quot; is there a sense of wonder ? &quot;
i &apos;ve been eating cer@@ e@@ al for break@@ fast all of my life .
so i do these val@@ ent@@ ines .
time spent with you is like ch@@ asing and cat@@ ching small birds , but without the scrat@@ ches and bird sh@@ it . &quot;
but i &apos;ve come to believe that truly imagin@@ ative visual work is extremely important in society .
this happens 1@@ 60 times per second , and if anything fa@@ ils in this process , re@@ zero would immediately fall to the ground .
due to the ball@@ bot system , it has a very small footprint and it &apos;s also easy to move around .
same with di@@ atoms , which are shown right here , which are gl@@ asse@@ ous structures .
what all these have in common is these materials are struc@@ tured at the nano@@ scale , and they have a dna sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blue@@ print to be able to build these really wonderful structures .
&quot; i have this great project -- 50 million years . &quot;
now if we could scale this , you could actually use it to run your pri@@ us , which is my dream -- to be able to drive a vir@@ us-@@ powered car .
so i &apos;m going to talk about work , specifically why people can &apos;t seem to get work done at work , which is a problem we all kind of have .
you almost never hear someone say the office .
you might have a quick idea , but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully , you need long stre@@ t@@ ches of un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted time .
so what are these inter@@ rup@@ tions that happen at the office that don &apos;t happen at other places ?
no one car@@ ed about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago , so why does everyone care about someone going to facebook here and there , or twitter here and there , or youtube here and there ?
what if they &apos;re doing important work ?
i have about three minutes , so that &apos;ll fit perfectly .
because work , like sleep , happens in ph@@ ases .
we live on a planet -- 6@@ .@@ 3 billion people .
ok , it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask .
and so we have these strategies to remember , and one of them was mentioned yesterday .
it could be a phone number , it could be an e-mail address , it could be a post@@ al address .
there &apos;s a second thing i like about this .
and i know what you &apos;re asking -- did i test it ?
when everyone &apos;s connected .
there &apos;s a significant del@@ ta , in fact , between what we &apos;re willing to accept .
this poor kid , clearly a pro@@ p -- don &apos;t get me wrong , a willing pro@@ p -- but the k@@ iss that &apos;s being docum@@ ented kind of looks like it su@@ cks .
the usual suspe@@ cts , like satur@@ ated fat and sugar , ni@@ cot@@ ine , op@@ i@@ ates , coca@@ ine , too much al@@ co@@ hol and chr@@ onic stress .
and that &apos;s johnny dep@@ p &apos;s shoulder .
until i tell you who said it .
now within that framework , we can obviously experience regre@@ t about a lot of different things .
when i went home that night after getting my tat@@ too , i basically stayed up all night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s also a fifth one .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; rep@@ ly all &quot; regre@@ ts can leave us in a fit of exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating ag@@ ony for days .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;m a perfe@@ c@@ tion@@ ist .
we &apos;re taught to try to live life without regre@@ t . but why ? using her own tat@@ too as an example , ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ z makes a powerful and moving case for embra@@ cing our regre@@ ts .
and thir@@ dly , because of the rise of non-@@ govern@@ mental organizations .
children &apos;s medicine was 600 dollars , because nobody could afford to buy any of it .
the systems are not there to reach the people .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about our team because it &apos;s indi@@ ca@@ tive of what we do .
about 40 percent of all the people who need t@@ b treatment are now getting it -- in just 18 months , up from zero when we started .
it &apos;s worth a try and i believe it would succeed .
the des@@ ks are not square .
when the tur@@ bine dro@@ ps in , it will produce 8@@ ,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people are bringing their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , to the green school .
local bal@@ in@@ ese women cook the food on sa@@ w@@ dust bur@@ ners using secre@@ ts that only their grand@@ mothers know .
we need someone to come and study it .
green school is a model we built for the world .
the doctors took a fi@@ bu@@ la bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new ja@@ w .
i tried out various computer voices that were available online , and for several months i had a british ac@@ cent , which cha@@ z called sir la@@ wr@@ ence . &quot;
so i sent them many hours of recor@@ dings of my voice , including several audio comm@@ entary tracks that i &apos;d made for movies on dv@@ ds .
but i &apos;ve got to say , in first grade , they said i talked too much , and now i still can .
the programm@@ ers said it could ass@@ ist students in their learning .
we are born into a box of time and space .
believe me , he didn &apos;t mean this as -- anyway , let me just read it .
the guy says , &quot; i want a second opinion . &quot;
20 years ago , bon@@ ni@@ er , swe@@ dish publi@@ sh@@ er , started to set new@@ spa@@ pers in the former soviet blo@@ c .
the secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece , as one com@@ position -- like music .
and then , usually after two months , we start designing .
so every year , june 16 , we will com@@ memor@@ ate all those com@@ ra@@ des or students who died .
my left leg got caught up in the wheel well -- spu@@ n it around .
but it &apos;s hard sometimes to talk about these things , so bear with me .
i needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being , since i &apos;d been eating through a tube in my chest and through my v@@ eins .
the red@@ und@@ an@@ cy was actually good for me .
so i was walking around it .
this is how he wrote most of his mathematics .
it is written in mathematical language , and the letters are tri@@ an@@ gles , circles and other ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric figures , without which means it is human@@ ly impossible to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end a single word . &quot;
so , i wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the al@@ ham@@ bra .
let &apos;s take the twi@@ sted six-@@ pointed star@@ fish .
so here is a little question for you .
let &apos;s do the refle@@ ction in x first , followed by the ro@@ tation by a third of a turn an@@ tic@@ lo@@ ck@@ wise .
and then there is an interesting place hal@@ f@@ way along an edge , where i can ro@@ tate by 1@@ 80 degrees .
but here is the language which describes how the symme@@ tries interact .
if i told you 20 or less , stand up .
let &apos;s go to 4@@ 0,000 years before the present , to the time of the cultural explosion , when music , art , technology , so many of the things that we &apos;re enjo@@ ying today , so many of the things that are being demon@@ strated at ted were born .
in the ancient world there was a lot of respect for un@@ intended consequences , and there was a very healthy sense of cau@@ tion , refle@@ cted in the tree of knowledge , in p@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box , and especially in the my@@ th of pro@@ me@@ the@@ us that &apos;s been so important in recent metaph@@ ors about technology .
and this was an important thing about 19th century technology , that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart , even when jud@@ ged by the most expert people .
so chemi@@ sts got to work , and they developed a bacteri@@ cide that became wid@@ ely used in those systems .
and he published that book in the early 193@@ 0s , and the book still exists in further edi@@ tions and is still a fundamental text@@ book .
you &apos;re supposed to learn this stuff how ?
i &apos;m not bit@@ ter .
and finally , it often happens that you &apos;re giving a talk , and for some reason the audience is looking at the slide instead of at you !
and once things are in a pile i can brow@@ se them by thro@@ wing them into a grid , or you know , flip through them like a book or i can lay them out like a de@@ ck of cards .
i can to@@ ss these things around . they &apos;re so much more tan@@ gible and tou@@ ch@@ able -- and you know i can dou@@ ble@@ -@@ click on something to take a look at it .
it &apos;s such an honor for me .
and i was thinking about this , of all places , on a trans@@ atlantic flight a couple of years ago , because i happened to be se@@ ated next to a hung@@ arian physicist about my age and we were talking about what life was like during the cold war for physi@@ ci@@ sts in hung@@ ary .
and he said , &quot; it &apos;s funny you ask that , because it &apos;s actually called black box tra@@ ding .
you can find these kinds of things wherever you look , once you learn how to look for them .
this isn &apos;t information .
and how far can you take that ? how far can you take it ?
but i can read this map , and what this map says is that , if you &apos;re trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are , that &apos;s where people are , where the cities are , you &apos;re going to have to put the ser@@ vers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively .
there &apos;s the one that cu@@ ts itself .
you know the funny thing is , i get my hands dri@@ er than people do with three or four , because they can &apos;t get in between the cra@@ cks .
ro@@ und@@ ab@@ ou@@ ts are much better .
dis@@ count that back to the present , at five percent : over two million dollars for a stop sign , in each direction .
so , now that you are all &quot; road schol@@ ars &quot; ...
so we really can make changes .
and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poor@@ er countries , it doesn &apos;t get much investment .
or , if you go in kind of half-@@ hear@@ ted@@ ly , for a period of time you &apos;ll reduce the disease bur@@ den , but eventually those tools will become in@@ effective , and the death rate will so@@ ar back up again .
i had great teachers .
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invest@@ ed in this .
they &apos;ve gone back and they &apos;ve gotten their master &apos;s of education .
they &apos;re team teaching . they &apos;re constantly impro@@ ving their teachers .
of course , digital video is cheap now .
governments don &apos;t naturally pick these things in the right way .
so many artists speak about nee@@ ding to be open , to embrace experience , and that &apos;s hard to do when you have a ligh@@ ted rec@@ tan@@ gle in your pocket that takes all of your focus .
j@@ b : richard ser@@ ra says that so non@@ ch@@ al@@ antly , you might have missed it . he went and saw this painting by a guy who &apos;d been dead for 300 years , and realized , &quot; i can &apos;t do that , &quot; and so richard ser@@ ra went back to his studio in fl@@ or@@ ence , picked up all of his work up to that point , and thre@@ w it in a river .
j@@ b : he did . he pulled in every fa@@ vor he could , and got a pass into the world trade center site , where he photographed for nine months almost every day .
and i &apos;ve come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us .
first day away from home , and already she &apos;s taking cand@@ y from a stran@@ ger ? ! &apos; &quot; and she said , &quot; everybody lost it . tw@@ enty feet in every direction , everyone started to ho@@ w@@ l .
we need to re@@ define leadership as being about l@@ ol@@ li@@ pop moments , how many of them we create , how many of them we ac@@ knowledge , how many of them we pay forward , and how many of them we say thank you for .
and because we no longer need to use sunlight , we have very speci@@ alized lights that are made for the operating room .
and very often they say , &quot; you know what , points a and b are okay , but point c , you still have some resi@@ du@@ al cancer there .
however , in the presence of the tumor , now there are molecular sc@@ is@@ sor@@ s that can break this molecule apart right there at the c@@ lea@@ vable site .
so what that means is if the ly@@ mp@@ h no@@ de did not have cancer , the woman would be saved from having un@@ necessary surgery .
that &apos;s a lot of people to have a lot of problems -- and this is even in so-called ner@@ ve-@@ spar@@ ing surgery , which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem , and they are trying to avoid the ner@@ ves .
do you guys know where the mar@@ g@@ ins of this tumor is ?
successful innovation is not a single break@@ through .
new ones are being discovered everyday .
and it also will affect normal circu@@ its as well as the ab@@ normal ones that you want to fix .
so all we &apos;ve got to do is take that dna , put it into a gene therapy v@@ ec@@ tor , like a virus , and put it into neurons .
so to do that , we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the fi@@ or@@ ell@@ a group , where one side of this little box , if the animal goes there , the animal gets a pul@@ se of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light .
there &apos;s no audio on this , but you can see the animal &apos;s free@@ zing .
there &apos;s another thing , which is you &apos;ve got to get these genes into cells .
now mice are smart , so this mouse sol@@ ves the ma@@ ze eventually , but he does a bru@@ te-@@ force search .
so our hope is to eventually build brain co@@ process@@ ors that work with the brain so we can aug@@ ment functions in people with dis@@ abilities .
if you look at the x-@@ axis of this graph , you &apos;ll see that what we common@@ ly want to do -- which is keeping the out@@ doors out -- we accompli@@ shed that with mechanical venti@@ lation .
j@@ essi@@ ca green : are we fil@@ ter@@ ing the wrong microbes ?
and it was a beautiful urban day , and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working .
i think that there is effectively a new kind of model of inter@@ activity that &apos;s starting to emerge online right now .
you can also r@@ ank it by the latest po@@ sts .
so you can do kind of interesting con@@ tests .
19@@ 35 -- re@@ lief , depression , recovery banks .
and so very quickly you can accu@@ mu@@ late a bunch of links , and it makes it more likely for new@@ com@@ ers to link to you in the future , and then you get this kind of shape .
what was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now r@@ ari@@ fied .
in a film@@ club season about democracy and government , we scre@@ ened &quot; mr. smith goes to washington . &quot;
&quot; per@@ se@@ poli@@ s &quot; brought a daughter closer to her irani@@ an mother , and &quot; ja@@ ws &quot; became the way in which one young boy was able to artic@@ u@@ late the fear he &apos;d experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother , the lat@@ ter thrown over@@ board on a boat journey .
pu@@ ri@@ sts may feel that fiction dis@@ si@@ pat@@ es the quest of real human understanding , that film is too cru@@ de to tell a complex and deta@@ iled history , or that film@@ makers always serve dra@@ ma over truth .
in 196@@ 2 , with ra@@ chel car@@ son &apos;s &quot; silent spring , &quot; i think for people like me in the world of the making of things , the can@@ ary in the mine wasn &apos;t singing .
so we use the tools of commer@@ ce pri@@ mar@@ ily for our work , but the question we bring to it is , how do we love all the children of all species for all time ?
this is a baby blan@@ ket by pen@@ d@@ le@@ ton that will give your child nutrition instead of alzheimer &apos;s later in life .
now if i was a bird , the building on my left is a li@@ ability .
perhaps that &apos;s away .
and as franc@@ is cri@@ ck pointed out , nine years after disco@@ vering dna with mr. wat@@ son , that life itself has to have growth as a pre@@ condition -- it has to have free energy , sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals .
wear your old shoes in , your new shoes out .
now we do it by molecule . these are our cities .
and this is the concept for the top of the city .
right ? it &apos;s pretty big .
we didn &apos;t know about dou@@ b@@ lear@@ row .
so is one of the parties lying , or is there some other alternative explanation ?
and the answer is , every single swe@@ dish business leader does that every single day .
because we have this thing called priv@@ acy , and if you really think that you have nothing to hide , please make sure that &apos;s the first thing you tell me , because then i know that i should not trust you with any secre@@ ts , because obviously you can &apos;t keep a secret .
her email was read , and she spoke at the united nations head@@ quarters , and she said , &quot; if there is no right to priv@@ acy , there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion , and therefore , there can be no effective democracy . &quot;
now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influ@@ enced by technology -- think google maps , think gps -- the same thing is happening for brain ma@@ pping through transformation .
so the ou@@ ter part of that brain is the neo@@ cortex .
and on these chromosom@@ es are roughly 2@@ 5,000 genes .
there &apos;s a bla@@ de here that &apos;s going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide .
there &apos;s a contain@@ er underneath that &apos;s collecting that tissue .
and each gene gives us a finger@@ print .
most of you are probably familiar with genom@@ e-@@ wide association studies in the form of people co@@ vering in the news saying , &quot; scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect x@@ . &quot;
and so what you &apos;re looking at here in don@@ or one and don@@ or four , which are the ex@@ ceptions to the other two , that genes are being turned on in a very specific sub@@ set of cells .
well , here is a thought experiment for you .
sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies .
they &apos;re not going to use them , or at least they &apos;re not going to use them as bed nets , maybe as fishing nets . &quot;
now , it &apos;s not because the vaccin@@ es are not there -- they are there and they are free -- and it &apos;s not because parents do not care about their kids .
now , a kil@@ o of l@@ enti@@ ls is tiny .
now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhe@@ tor@@ ic .
but what politicians need is a range of options .
so for every hundred dollars you spend doing that , you get 40 extra years of education .
i gave you three simple answers to three questions : give l@@ enti@@ ls to imm@@ uni@@ ze people , provide free bed nets , de@@ wor@@ m children .
i cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference , but can we come back here in 30 years and say , &quot; what we have done , it really pro@@ mp@@ ted a change for the better . &quot;
but this is about africa , the story we have not heard .
you should have seen my parents &apos; reaction !
let &apos;s start un@@ pac@@ king it .
it &apos;s meaning@@ less .
the new report , &quot; the next el@@ even , &quot; high@@ lights that by 20@@ 20 nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world .
close to the medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an , near alex@@ and@@ ria -- tex@@ tiles , pe@@ tro@@ chemicals .
nigeria : 70 percent of roads are un@@ tar@@ red . z@@ ambi@@ a : 80 percent .
they &apos;re doing it because they are expe@@ cting things to happen .
beauty and se@@ du@@ ction is nature &apos;s tools for survival , because we protect what we fall in love with .
we so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment , with clouds coming and going .
and what i discovered is , because of the nature of the footage and the fact that we &apos;re doing this film , there was an emotion that was built into it and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us and all these various things .
it &apos;s what you dream about .
so i &apos;m going to just let it run , so you kind of absor@@ b this sort of thing , and i &apos;ll describe my sort of re@@ actions when i was looking at it for the very first time .
it was a long film to work on .
so , all i can say is , thank you , and that &apos;s my presentation for you .
you know , if you actually think about it , if somebody is totally blind -- a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms , where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things .
kb : second sight is where@@ by a mind-@@ control expert can see through somebody else &apos;s eyes .
we &apos;re ok , though ?
can you come up ?
ni@@ co@@ le : no .
ni@@ co@@ le : three -- kb : like a ti@@ ck@@ ling sen@@ sation ?
ok , now , in a moment , you &apos;ll feel a certain pressure , ok , and i want you to be aware of the pressure .
only when you want the pressure to go back , make a down@@ ward gest@@ ure .
excellent .
i also want you to think of his name . look at me and think of his name .
kb : ok , steve , i want you to take a seat , right behind here . excellent .
no , stay around , ok .
kb : i &apos;m over a cup , right now ?
s@@ j : u@@ h , neither .
i am one of the one in four . thank you .
oh , and that &apos;s not even the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg .
evolution did not prepare us for this . we just don &apos;t have the band@@ wid@@ th , and for people who say , oh , they &apos;re having a nice day , they &apos;re perfectly fine , they &apos;re more in@@ san@@ e than the rest of us .
and i personally am obsessed with morality .
in other words , i thought i could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral .
the trick is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them .
i used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain .
so i tend to avoid that .
i &apos;ll be there and i &apos;ll give him a $ 200 reward . &quot;
one is through impro@@ per nur@@ turing .
she had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
two weeks ago , i just got back from pa@@ pu@@ a new gu@@ ine@@ a where i went up to the hig@@ hl@@ ands -- very isol@@ ated tribes of sub@@ si@@ st@@ ence farmers living as they have lived for millen@@ ia .
and you can look far back into the past , but if you look at pres@@ ent-@@ day school@@ ing the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to figure out where it came from .
they do need to be able to read .
so i said , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s possible . &quot;
i gave them a spe@@ ech@@ -to-@@ text engine in a computer , and i said , &quot; keep talking into it until it types what you say . &quot;
so i said , &quot; well , what did i expect ? &quot;
when i saw that graph i knew there is a way to level the playing field .
pun@@ ish@@ ment and exam@@ in@@ ations are seen as thre@@ ats .
children : you can &apos;t catch me .
there was a time when stone age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say , &quot; what are those t@@ win@@ kl@@ ing lights ? &quot;
there &apos;s only one gran@@ ny who man@@ ages health and safety .
and then i &apos;ll kind of be like -- -- and then they &apos;re like , &quot; who@@ a ! &quot;
i think of it almost like like a yo@@ ga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
so this story is the first of 18 chap@@ ters in my new body of work ti@@ t@@ led &quot; a living man dec@@ lar@@ ed dead and other chap@@ ters . &quot;
and these are studies com@@ mission@@ ed by the zi@@ on@@ ist organization for alternative areas for jewish sett@@ le@@ ment .
during the course of this trial , all of the rab@@ bits died , except for a few , which were eu@@ th@@ ani@@ zed .
you can also see the evolution of the one-@@ chil@@ d-@@ only policy as it tra@@ vels through the bloo@@ d@@ line .
but it got violent in the last two decades and includes de@@ capit@@ ation and the death of two may@@ ors .
and this mass pile of images and stories forms an archi@@ ve .
but here i &apos;m being told that the piece of music is very quick .
by holding it ti@@ ghtly , i feel str@@ angel@@ y more deta@@ ched .
same amount of weight , but different sound colors .
but yet , we get the sen@@ sation of something happening .
in another year &apos;s time , three extra steps .
maybe i can use my je@@ wel@@ ry to create extra sounds .
we had to study from study books .
tom green : that &apos;s a 4@@ ch@@ an thing .
there are thousands of memes that come out of the site .
it &apos;s that they weren &apos;t putting me at the top of this list ; they were actually -- it got so sophisticated to the point where they gam@@ ed all of the top 21 places to sp@@ ell &quot; mar@@ ble@@ ca@@ ke . also , the game . &quot;
c@@ p : you &apos;re lucky that this is not being stre@@ amed to them live right now .
love and peace were mentioned .
c@@ p : yeah . they still didn &apos;t know what to think of that though .
you want to measure it by diversity ?
so , all the other dinosaurs that you know , or your kids know , at least , on four legs .
so , 1@@ 25 degrees is normal .
this was the cover of science , because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals , but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the at@@ titudes remain the same . anyway , smaller ra@@ p@@ tors .
paul ser@@ en@@ o : let &apos;s get this tape measure on him . put it right there .
it &apos;s really an island continent .
now we have diver@@ gence over time , but we &apos;ve created the third dimension of area .
they &apos;re really kin@@ dre@@ d discipl@@ ines .
you have to have those steps . if you have -- it &apos;s easy to get kids interested in science .
you give her a quick cra@@ ck in the teeth with your el@@ bow and bla@@ ze for the finish line .
they &apos;re not doing 26 miles ; they &apos;re doing 100 , 150 miles at a time , and apparently without in@@ jury , without problems .
there &apos;s not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been .
so about seven years , eight years to reach your peak , and then gradu@@ ally you fall off your peak , until you go back to the starting point .
you need a pack to pull together .
and what happened was we started creating these fan@@ cy c@@ us@@ hi@@ oned things , which can make running &quot; better , &quot; called running shoes .
but maybe there &apos;s another benefit there as well .
for me , that was the white space ; that &apos;s what robots could not do yet .
he &apos;s a scary monster .
you call your friend , she puts her hand@@ set in a robot , and , b@@ am ! you &apos;re a me@@ bot -- you can make eye contact , you can talk with your friends , you can move around , you can gest@@ ure -- maybe the next best thing to really being there , or is it ?
i imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer , open up a brow@@ ser and jack into a little robot .
to explore that question , we did a study in the boston area where we put one of three interven@@ tions in people &apos;s homes for a period of several weeks .
but we can push this idea further .
robots touch something deeply human within us .
and i can &apos;t have my pos@@ se laugh@@ in &apos; at me .
and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
i can master shock of &quot; the crying game &quot; with the a@@ we of a child being called an aids vic@@ tim by a bul@@ ly who didn &apos;t know that it was his father who gave it to my mother , and that &apos;s a double ent@@ end@@ re .
i then went on wondering whether i could actually replace her image , so i got a loo@@ k-@@ ali@@ ke of di@@ ana and posed her in the right positions and an@@ gles and created something that was in , or existed in , the public imagination .
well , here is the image .
so , all this work is getting shown in art galler@@ ies .
this image is quite interesting , actually , because i think we made it three years ago .
what jack ni@@ chol@@ son might be up to in his cele@@ bri@@ ty life , and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road ra@@ ge and gol@@ f-@@ clu@@ b@@ bed a driver the other day .
has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night , and you start getting chest pa@@ ins , shor@@ t@@ ness of breath , swe@@ ating ?
that is something to keep in mind . we can &apos;t deal with it with situations like this .
we have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained , board cer@@ ti@@ fied in the usa , canada or britain .
and we will do other centers .
they need to be alive , they need to feed .
we &apos;re also starting an@@ c@@ ill@@ ary heal@@ th-@@ care technology training programs -- training people in e@@ cho@@ car@@ di@@ ograph@@ y , car@@ di@@ a@@ c ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und , those kinds of things . now , with that kind of training , it gives people motivation .
and i actually feel at home here , because there &apos;s a lot of autism gene@@ tics here .
my dra@@ wings got to star in the movie too .
and the way i sold live@@ stock jobs is i showed off my dra@@ wings , i showed off pictures of things .
i was really concerned about having to wear this g@@ ad@@ get on my face .
i find a lot of people have difficul@@ ty doing that .
he was now dr. car@@ lock in the movie .
and when i was 13 , i had a job at a d@@ res@@ s@@ maker &apos;s shop se@@ wing clothes .
because what i &apos;m obser@@ ving is the good teachers , for a lot of these kids , are out in the community colle@@ ges , but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
what are you most passionate about ?
now my own speci@@ ality is combin@@ ing digital technology and magic .
b@@ ye@@ -@@ b@@ ye .
and it was deep . it was deep in my soul .
now there &apos;s a talent un@@ to itself .
and now the shore is coming , and there &apos;s just a little part of me that &apos;s sad .
thank you .
the first problem is there &apos;s in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate disaster response .
they send him to iraq .
i think it &apos;s very important , because right now somebody needs to step up , and this generation of veter@@ ans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance .
what would this lead to ?
and so they invented the scientific journal as a way of synchr@@ oni@@ zing the argument across the community of natural scientists .
the programm@@ ers come and go .
this has the following effect : a program@@ mer in e@@ din@@ burgh and a program@@ mer in ent@@ e@@ b@@ be can both get the same -- a copy of the same piece of software .
right .
it was the expec@@ tation of the citizens that she would not be cen@@ sor@@ ed .
this one i thought i &apos;d show you .
mor@@ gan hen@@ dry : be@@ ware of safety is an instru@@ mental rock band .
so we literally are all made out of star@@ dust .
and if you look at the top left , you see a little teen@@ y dark dot .
okay , we have par@@ ach@@ ute al@@ ig@@ ned .
bc : we enter the mar@@ ti@@ an atmosphere .
that &apos;s when we separate from the back shell , and we &apos;re now in fre@@ e-@@ fall .
then we get a little bit more serious , so we have what we call our c@@ ad / cam@@ s and all the engineers who are involved , or scientists who are involved , who know about ther@@ mal properties , know about design , know about atmosp@@ her@@ ic interaction , par@@ ach@@ utes , all of these things , which they work in a team effort and actually design a spac@@ ec@@ raft in a computer to some extent , so to see , does that meet the requi@@ rement that we need .
but also , if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cli@@ ff , we have a little laser system which will actually za@@ p the rock , ev@@ apo@@ rate some of it , and actually analy@@ ze what &apos;s coming from that rock .
so as we flew by away from it , we looked back . and guess what ?
you just drive to the near@@ est lake , stick your ho@@ se in it , and you &apos;ve got your car filled up .
so if we start to think exponenti@@ ally , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
and of course , there &apos;s an app for that .
you can t@@ we@@ et your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line .
how about aug@@ ment@@ ing the physi@@ cian ?
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; fantastic voy@@ age , &quot; the i@@ p@@ ill .
in genom@@ ics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
we can be pre@@ vent@@ ative ; that pre@@ vention can be person@@ alized ; and more importantly , it &apos;s going to become increasingly partici@@ pat@@ ory .
we &apos;ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of top@@ ics , particularly in car@@ dio@@ vas@@ cular disease .
the first one is dedicated to spen@@ cer , and his grandmother , who was sho@@ cked by his work .
in those days there was still coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side close to the city , far@@ ms , cor@@ n@@ fields , co@@ ws ; even not far from our building with its bl@@ ur@@ red bri@@ ck and long sha@@ dow@@ y hall@@ way you could find tra@@ cts with h@@ ills and trees you could pre@@ tend were mountains and forests .
the girl , my old love , the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party , her dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ly stum@@ bling , falling , spra@@ w@@ ling , sk@@ ir@@ t hi@@ ked , eyes v@@ ein@@ ed red , s@@ wollen with te@@ ars , her shame , her dis@@ honor .
this is called &quot; thir@@ st . &quot;
a cas@@ ual impul@@ se , a fan@@ cy , never thought of until now , hardly thought of even now ...
the girls , to my hor@@ ror , a@@ ver@@ ted their ga@@ ze .
c@@ .@@ k. willi@@ ams : poetry of you@@ th and age
sam@@ u@@ el pis@@ ar , an au@@ schwi@@ tz survi@@ vor , said , and i &apos;ll quote him , &quot; the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st teach@@ es us that nature , even in its cru@@ el@@ est moments , is ben@@ ig@@ n in compar@@ ison with man , when he loses his moral comp@@ ass and his reason . &quot;
but images don &apos;t need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
what we &apos;re going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes i &apos;ve got left , is to try and answer three questions . the first one is , why ?
that was our h@@ f radio anten@@ na .
two nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans did it as a team in 2000 . no one &apos;s done it sol@@ o .
when the ice was flat or fl@@ at@@ tish , i could just about pull both .
some pretty radical technology , a radical approach -@@ -@@ but it worked perfectly .
i took a photo of that . sat down on my sle@@ dge . did a sort of video di@@ ary piece .
i thought , it &apos;ll have to do .
this is probably why i didn &apos;t get into trouble about the length of my air@@ stri@@ p .
since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed -- this was 9@@ 3 years ago -- since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed from the coast of ant@@ arc@@ tica to the pole and back .
but i was still concerned , so i said , &quot; you know what , i &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
and i remember@@ ed that the old and dr@@ unken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
i do want to leave you with one positive thought .
but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ?
these were the fears that dan@@ ced in the imagin@@ ations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would gover@@ n whether they lived or died .
what would happen to our minds ?
the no@@ ve@@ list v@@ la@@ di@@ mir n@@ abo@@ ko@@ v said that the best rea@@ der has a combination of two very different temper@@ am@@ ents , the artistic and the scientific .
i &apos;m 43 years old right now .
therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home .
and while this was the major difference between many initi@@ a@@ tives before to create change , before we thought , and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was im@@ posed on us , and people reje@@ cted that , because they thought that it is alien to their culture .
i remember one night when someone ph@@ oned me on my cell@@ phone -- ordinary person who i don &apos;t know -- from ta@@ hri@@ r square .
is this a stor@@ y-@@ of-@@ the-@@ year , a stor@@ y-@@ of-@@ the-@@ decade or something more ?
they &apos;ve had some speakers there .
and frank@@ ie says , &quot; i &apos;m number 22 in line , and i can see the need@@ le coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
you don &apos;t want to share a need@@ le anymore than you want to share a to@@ oth@@ brush even with someone you &apos;re sle@@ eping with .
so what we &apos;ve been doing in the united states is re@@ vie@@ wing the data -- end@@ less@@ ly re@@ vie@@ wing the data .
they are gay men on the party scene who have , on average , three times more partners than straight people on the party scene .
but it is changing the equation of what &apos;s rational in sexual decisi@@ on-@@ making .
what does that mean ?
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that &apos;s one of the gl@@ ories of human existence .
and i &apos;d pull her out on the front por@@ ch .
it &apos;s called cla@@ w-@@ ham@@ mer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother .
it sounds something like this .
we were standing on the edge of thousands of ac@@ res of cot@@ ton .
now , my mother hop@@ ed that we learned from that the value of hard work .
good news : ch@@ ari@@ ot &apos;s coming .
but then , when i thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things .
and we moved across the street from michael and john whit@@ ney .
they said they were going to beat us up if we didn &apos;t make some g@@ un@@ po@@ w@@ der for them .
so let me put them all together . and also , i can change the sounds by ste@@ pping on this pe@@ dal right here , and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little ham@@ bone sol@@ o or something like this .
not only is there a relationship between the eth@@ ics of science and the eth@@ ics of being a citi@@ zen in democracy , but there has been , histor@@ ically , a relationship between how people think about space and time , and what the co@@ smo@@ s is , and how people think about the society that they live in .
and mer@@ ging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity , is the cul@@ min@@ ation of that , something that &apos;s going on right now .
now , darwin taught us that there are processes of self-@@ organization that suff@@ ice to explain all of us and everything we see .
in fact , i &apos;m finished . science will never go away .
i can see my work as a job . i do it for money .
so i looked for furniture .
he can seat , throughout the year , he can seat 8@@ ,000 people .
what came out of it ?
there is a full-@@ blo@@ wn orchestra living inside the building .
these are some pictures vis@@ it@@ ors sent to me .
and the monkeys in that monkey forest looked , actually , fairly happy .
so even as we share death as a universal experience , it &apos;s not experienced the same way the world over .
and it &apos;s also a moment of self-@@ awareness .
but i see something pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly transforma@@ tive in experi@@ encing death as a social process and not just a biological one .
one of the -- thank you for invi@@ ting us .
but you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving the planet , global institutions .
why would you do that ? why would -- it &apos;s like one step up from re@@ pl@@ ying to one of those e@@ mails from nigeria , isn &apos;t it ?
but we have a new hope . we have a new man .
and he spoke to the crowd in chicago , he said , &quot; if there is anyone out there who still dou@@ b@@ ts that america is a place where all things are possible ... &quot;
do you remember that ? george bush , &quot; a nu@@ -@@ ca@@ -@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
and there &apos;s lots of different shapes .
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different .
they don &apos;t like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside .
so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are .
what &apos;s interesting is the spi@@ ke on the back of the dra@@ cor@@ e@@ x was growing very fast as well .
and then , because the ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es are in my collection , i cut them open and look inside .
here &apos;s another one .
four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders love their dinosaurs , they memor@@ ize them .
so , this is just in construction , and there &apos;s a ten@@ se@@ gri@@ ty structure .
so in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , we were mostly known for independent work , such as installation artist , architect , com@@ mission@@ ed projects by muse@@ ums and non-@@ for@@ -@@ profit organizations .
it selec@@ ts a point , it gui@@ des the drill to that point , it pier@@ ces the dry wall , leaving a half-@@ inch hole before traveling to the next location .
in this very nar@@ row space that conne@@ cts east and west galler@@ ies the inten@@ tion was really to not get a cli@@ ma@@ x , but to have the view stal@@ k you , so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other .
now , that &apos;s really tough to do with a hall that has 1,@@ 100 seats .
and for us , i mean it &apos;s really kind of a very strange thing , but the moments in the hall that the bu@@ zz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin , very similar to the par@@ ting of cur@@ tains or the raising of a chan@@ deli@@ er , the walls will just ex@@ u@@ de this glo@@ w , tempor@@ arily ste@@ aling attention from the stage .
m@@ ck@@ in@@ ley wri@@ tes that the community &apos;s wondering , &quot; how could their boys have been drawn into this ? &quot;
so for her graduate work , she did a three-@@ part series on the mur@@ der of 11 women found bu@@ ried on albu@@ quer@@ que &apos;s west mes@@ a .
this is its cover from november 15 , 2010 .
i never heard anyone say this about anderson co@@ oper and his cre@@ w who were attac@@ ked co@@ vering the same story .
we need four shoul@@ der-@@ high plants per person , and in terms of plant care , we need to wi@@ pe the leaves every day in delhi , and perhaps once a week in clean@@ er-@@ air cities .
ka@@ mal me@@ attle : how to grow fresh air
so how do you feel about that -- the whole -- m well , it &apos;s pretty irri@@ tat@@ ing actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing .
but i have to tell you , i have my yo@@ un@@ gest grand@@ daughter , when she turned seven last year , said to her mother , my daughter , &quot; so what &apos;s the big deal about grand@@ ma ma@@ d@@ die being secre@@ tary of state ?
and we lo@@ b@@ bi@@ ed on be@@ half of women &apos;s issues .
pm : so how do we get this balance we &apos;re looking for , then , in the world ?
three thousand years ago , civilization just getting started on the banks of the ni@@ le , some sla@@ ves , jewish she@@ pher@@ ds in this instance , sm@@ elling of sheep sh@@ it , i guess , pro@@ cla@@ im@@ ed to the phar@@ a@@ oh , sitting high on his thr@@ one , &quot; we , your ma@@ je@@ st@@ y-@@ ness , are equal to you . &quot;
this is michael and ben@@ edi@@ c@@ ta , and they &apos;re alive thanks in large part to dr. patri@@ cia as@@ amo@@ ah -- she &apos;s amazing -- and the global fund , which all of you finan@@ cially support , whether you know it or not .
so the pri@@ de of li@@ ons is the proof of concept .
you can join the one campaign , and leaders like mo i@@ bra@@ him , the tele@@ com entrepren@@ eur .
might we answer that cl@@ ari@@ on call with science , with reason , with facts , and , d@@ are i say it , emotions ?
but one , to me , that &apos;s most comp@@ elling is the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar sensi@@ tivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development -- the output .
and what happens if you water and feed that seed appropri@@ ately , is it will do a develop@@ mental compu@@ tation , a molecular compu@@ tation , and it &apos;ll build an electronic computer .
and i &apos;m going to draw it like this sometimes , just so i don &apos;t sc@@ are you .
when you look at dna origami , you can see that what it really is , even though you think it &apos;s complicated , is a bunch of double heli@@ ces that are parallel to each other , and they &apos;re held together by places where short str@@ ands go along one heli@@ x and then jump to another one .
and you can make a map of the americ@@ as and sp@@ ell dna with dna .
and we like to draw these tiles as little squ@@ ares .
you have a very sensitive computer program where small changes -- single , tiny , little mu@@ tations -- can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger .
i want you to remember that to create life &apos;s very diverse and complex forms , life uses compu@@ tation to do that .
for those from the developing world , there is nothing , absolutely nothing new in this idea .
often it is the constra@@ ining or the back@@ -to-@@ the-@@ wall situation that the ha@@ pl@@ ess common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bri@@ be .
i pro@@ pose to explore this idea further , to exam@@ ine the potential of creating kind of service to stop bri@@ bes and prevent corruption .
and he will push us back .
so we can take their tran@@ script and actually do some pretty cool things .
what you &apos;re getting is a range of smaller conversations , each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share , creating a bro@@ a@@ der concept of the environment .
and we could go back to those top@@ ics and say , well , what talks are central to those conversations ?
oceans of adoles@@ cents come here to receive lessons but never learn to swim , part like the red sea when the bell r@@ ings .
and he appe@@ aled to virtu@@ e .
a wise person is like a jazz musi@@ cian -- using the notes on the page , but dancing around them , inv@@ enting combin@@ ations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand .
so he brought it back .
fix the incentives , fix the incentives , fix the incentives ...
but too many rules prevent accompli@@ shed jazz musicians from improvis@@ ing .
get smar@@ ter incentives .
and demand that the people who teach you ac@@ knowledge them and celebrate them too .
ordinary heroes like the jan@@ it@@ ors who are worth celebr@@ ating too .
obama appe@@ aled to virtu@@ e .
they proce@@ ed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following . we have used such advanced technologies now and made them available h@@ ills of afghanistan , iraq ...
now , i cannot imagine -- i &apos;m sorry , you may have a better imagination than i do -- i can &apos;t imagine losing my arm , and typically at 22 years old .
he &apos;s literally , he &apos;s got no shoulder on one side , and he &apos;s high trans@@ -@@ hum@@ er@@ al on the other .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether the department of defense likes this arm . &quot;
if we needed this or this , what would you want ? &quot;
and they shi@@ pped him to germany and 24 hours later they shi@@ pped him from germany to wal@@ ter re@@ ed .
&quot; you need to come . &quot;
i was talking to one of them , and he was really li@@ king this arm -- it &apos;s way , way , way better than a plastic stick with a ho@@ ok on it -- but there &apos;s nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got .
this is a time of need .
and all because he decided to walk that day .
my next pur@@ suit was i wanted to see how long i could go without breathing , like how long i could survive with nothing , not even air .
and he said , &quot; david , you &apos;re a magi@@ cian , create the illusion of not breathing , it will be much easier . &quot;
that was the one that i studied .
i &apos;m six foot one , and fat .
and by seven minutes i had gone into these awful con@@ vul@@ sions .
so , he suddenly pus@@ hed the record up to 16 minutes and 32 seconds .
so , normally i would start at 3@@ 8 be@@ ats per minute , and while holding my breath it would drop to 12 be@@ ats per minute , which is pretty unusual .
at 15 minutes i was suffering major o@@ 2 depri@@ vation to the heart .
as a magi@@ cian i try to show things to people that seem impossible .
mm : and that lin@@ king of the digital content to something that &apos;s physical is what we call an au@@ ra , and i &apos;ll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk .
oh , that is so cool .
tam@@ ara rou@@ ka@@ er@@ ts : we &apos;re ready to go .
but there &apos;s also a wonderful case for optimis@@ m .
last year , there were 8@@ 5,000 ri@@ ots in china , 2@@ 30 a day , that required police or military intervention .
looking at the five major ri@@ vers that feed bangladesh .
last year , there were only 2,000 cases in the world .
and on april 14@@ th , there will be step up day , where there will be a thousand individual mobili@@ zed social activ@@ ist movements in the united states on pro@@ test against legis@@ lation -- pushing for legis@@ lation to stop global warming .
but , in the end , we succe@@ e@@ ded , and the last case of smallpox : this little girl , ra@@ hi@@ ma ban@@ u -- bar@@ is@@ al , in bangladesh -- when she cou@@ gh@@ ed or brea@@ th@@ ed , and the last virus of smallpox left her l@@ ungs and fell on the di@@ rt and the sun killed that last virus , thus ended a chain of trans@@ mission of history &apos;s greatest hor@@ ror .
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choo@@ sing off@@ spring that looked a particular way and then bre@@ eding them .
and what you see here is these cells glo@@ wing in the dark under certain wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths of light .
so in the lower right here , you have dol@@ ly , the first c@@ lon@@ ed sheep -- now happ@@ ily stu@@ ff@@ ed in a museum in e@@ din@@ burgh ; r@@ al@@ ph the rat , the first c@@ lon@@ ed rat ; c@@ c the cat , for c@@ lon@@ ed cat ; s@@ nu@@ pp@@ y , the first c@@ lon@@ ed dog -- s@@ nu@@ pp@@ y for se@@ ou@@ l national university pu@@ pp@@ y -- created in south korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up res@@ ig@@ ning in dis@@ grace because he cla@@ im@@ ed he had c@@ lon@@ ed a human embr@@ yo , which he had not .
and what they &apos;ve done here is they &apos;ve put electro@@ des in its gan@@ gli@@ a and its brain and then a transmit@@ ter on top , and it &apos;s on a big computer tracking ball .
there &apos;s also been work done with monkeys .
this is where we are in this process .
it is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future .
he had seen people of different colors living in different places .
it &apos;s very de@@ struc@@ tive , but it also cat@@ aly@@ zes the production of vitam@@ in d in the skin , vitam@@ in d being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones , the health of our immune system , and my@@ ri@@ ad other important functions in our bodies .
ligh@@ tly pig@@ mented skin evolved not just once , not just twice , but probably three times .
we live in a world where we have ligh@@ tly and dark@@ ly pig@@ mented people living next to one another , but often brought into pro@@ x@@ im@@ ity ini@@ tially as a result of very invi@@ di@@ ous social interactions .
you can understand it .
others of them are very real , in a certain sense .
this is very r@@ ough , and this is sort of smo@@ oth , and this perfectly smo@@ oth .
so what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung , but it bran@@ ches and bran@@ ches down to di@@ stances about the same for a whale , for a man and for a little ro@@ dent .
it was very important , but mostly interesting because a kind of break , a separ@@ ation between the mathematics coming from reality , on the one hand , and new mathematics coming from pure man &apos;s mind .
so he painted it , which means he put inside everything . he said : &quot; well , this thing came out ... &quot; and i said , &quot; stop ! stop ! stop !
for 50 years , people were sort of po@@ o@@ h-@@ po@@ o@@ hing me because they could do it much , much easier .
i don &apos;t want to explain these things .
i want to start on a slightly som@@ ber note .
if you &apos;re wondering why , i &apos;ll tell you why in a few seconds from now .
bab@@ a shi@@ v : who@@ a !
and under what situations , when would we see this pattern of results where the passen@@ ger is going to show better , more favor@@ able outcomes compared to the driver ?
and therefore , there are times when you &apos;re facing the in@@ ca , when the feedback is going to be immedi@@ ate , negative , concrete , and you have the sense of agency , where you &apos;re far better off taking the passen@@ ger &apos;s seat and have someone else drive .
most africans today , by far , are farmers .
so why didn &apos;t agriculture markets perform to expectations ?
this made it un@@ prof@@ itable for some farmers to even harv@@ est the grain from the fields .
and in fact , would even du@@ mp the grain in lake mich@@ ig@@ an , rather than spend more money transpor@@ ting it back to their far@@ ms .
so that farmers and small tra@@ ders can actually come to a termin@@ al center -- what we call the remote access termin@@ al centers -- and actually , without having to buy a computer or figure out how to di@@ al up or any of those things , simply see the tra@@ ding that &apos;s happening on the add@@ is ab@@ ab@@ a tra@@ ding floor .
ethiopia &apos;s domesti@@ c market is about one billion dollars of value .
as rocks and mountains die , gra@@ ins of sand are born .
i went to so@@ ko@@ to in northern nigeria to try and find out how far away it is .
inside of the dun@@ es we find sha@@ de .
so , we pus@@ hed the pil@@ es down through the dun@@ e , and we create an initial bacteri@@ al surface .
bor@@ ges said that &quot; nothing is built on stone , everything is built on sand , but we must build as if the sand were stone . &quot;
i realized that the truly appropriate , low-@@ cost tools that i needed to start a sustainable farm and sett@@ le@@ ment just didn &apos;t exist yet .
we &apos;re exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology .
it &apos;s the runs , the her@@ s@@ hey squ@@ ir@@ ts , the squ@@ its .
sh@@ it off@@ ends people . fe@@ ces is too medical .
it &apos;s not just in the poor world that po@@ op can save lives .
she &apos;d grown up with a lat@@ r@@ ine .
we &apos;re not going to meet tar@@ gets , providing people with san@@ itation at this rate .
and this picture here , it &apos;s really interesting , it shows two things : first of all , it &apos;s in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far , and film was so slow in the 196@@ 0s and early 70s , you took pictures in black and white .
we hear a lot about the collapse of co@@ d .
and the habitat destruction is unbelie@@ vable .
and in the process they use up all the oxygen , and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment u@@ tter@@ ly leth@@ al for anything that can &apos;t swim away .
think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the nor@@ th@@ west pas@@ sage .
i mean , because we , at this point , we can protect it .
in the summer of 1950 , en@@ ri@@ co fer@@ m@@ i , the itali@@ an-@@ american physicist and atom@@ ic@@ -@@ pile buil@@ der , went to lunch at los al@@ am@@ os national laboratory and joined some colleagues there , and asked them a question : &quot; where is everybody ? &quot;
and if en@@ ri@@ co fer@@ m@@ i were indeed a space alien , wouldn &apos;t he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here ?
and then his gir@@ l@@ friend joined in , too .
she had long , cur@@ ly black hair , a blue je@@ an jac@@ ket .
when the movie ended , everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the the@@ at@@ re as soon as possible .
think about it . yes . the answer is : i had a gir@@ l@@ friend . what ?
it took me some time to come to my senses .
an event like this leaves a sc@@ ar on the memory , much like a piece of alien technology that has been in@@ ser@@ ted into your bu@@ t@@ to@@ cks by a &quot; portu@@ gu@@ ese doctor . &quot;
and i want to ask the question -- and we &apos;ll give them that two percent hi@@ ke in income , in sal@@ ary each year as well , because we believe in growth .
and this , this is where it gets interesting , because it turns out that human beings have something of an appe@@ ti@@ te for no@@ vel@@ ty .
and almost straig@@ h@@ ta@@ way we actually run up against a couple of an@@ om@@ ali@@ es .
&quot; what is the obje@@ ctive of the consumer ? &quot;
what would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stre@@ t@@ ched them along these or@@ th@@ og@@ onal dimensions of the human psy@@ che ?
it has social and psychological a@@ ims -- family , friend@@ ship , commit@@ ments , society , particip@@ ating in the life of that society .
we &apos;re actually all happier , and a country &apos;s more beautiful , and our lives are better . &quot;
what i do in my art is i ski@@ p the can@@ v@@ as al@@ together , and if i want to paint your portrait , i &apos;m painting it on you , physically on you .
i had no idea where to begin .
but then again , i guess it &apos;s also not un@@ for@@ es@@ ee@@ able that you can find the strange in the familiar , as long as you &apos;re willing to look beyond what &apos;s already been brought to light , that you can see what &apos;s below the surface , hi@@ ding in the sha@@ do@@ ws , and recognize that there can be more there than me@@ ets the eye .
those are called the as@@ p@@ halten@@ es ; they &apos;re an ingre@@ dient in as@@ p@@ halt .
i am hel@@ pl@@ ess over this . &quot;
the oil industry is like a huge , gigan@@ tic oc@@ top@@ us of engineering and finance and everything else , but we actually see it in very moral terms .
and so i &apos;m not saying these guys aren &apos;t li@@ able to answer questions -- i &apos;m just saying that , when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of gre@@ e@@ dy ba@@ star@@ ds , you don &apos;t actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate , or you &apos;re going to get around to really re@@ ducing the amount of oil and re@@ ducing our depen@@ dence on oil .
the only thing that really redu@@ ces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices .
that was the beginning of an es@@ cal@@ ating u.s. invol@@ vement there that we do not pay for at the pump .
it comes in on the side -- the useful stuff is the dark gray , and the un-@@ useful stuff , which is called the reje@@ cted energy -- the waste , goes up to the top .
and so this -- you can see that you &apos;re paying consider@@ ably less than the health care costs on the tax .
we must go to watch &quot; afgh@@ an star . &quot;
but actually , just the opposite is happening .
and i remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers , and my fingers were literally the size of sau@@ sages because -- you know , we &apos;re made par@@ tially of water -- when water free@@ zes it exp@@ ands , and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and exp@@ anded and bur@@ st .
and all the way along the gl@@ aci@@ er we saw these big po@@ ols of mel@@ ting ice .
take some time to rest and think about things .
so anyway , who am i ?
this one is a two-@@ bit counter .
can we get self-@@ repli@@ cat@@ ing-@@ type behavior ?
so what i &apos;m showing you here is that we can make a 2@@ d shape -- the b -- assem@@ ble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
and then literally , you now po@@ ur on a mon@@ om@@ er .
so , i &apos;m thinking about , how can we gener@@ alize the way we make all sorts of things , so you end up with this sort of guy , right ?
and so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that . so that &apos;s sort of another interesting aspect of the future .
basically , we sub@@ stit@@ ute , in our lives , access to the things we want .
some of it is about walking . it &apos;s not all perfect yet .
these things actually become cheaper to build than the alterna@@ tives .
this has led to a common understanding of our situation , nam@@ ely that moder@@ nity has brought us terrible violence , and perhaps that native peop@@ les lived in a state of harmon@@ y that we have de@@ par@@ ted from , to our per@@ il .
and , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 6@@ 5,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 195@@ 0s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade , as horri@@ fic as it is .
also suppor@@ ting it is the fact that we today see er@@ up@@ tions of violence in z@@ ones of an@@ arch@@ y , in failed states , collap@@ sed emp@@ ires , fron@@ tier regions , ma@@ fi@@ as , street gan@@ gs and so on .
the dr@@ c is a dangerous place .
what is it that you think about just before you get a con@@ dom ?
everyone knows , &quot; they say .
so we have countries living there .
you can see how the brown bub@@ bles , which is west europe , and the yellow one , which is the united states , they get ri@@ cher and ri@@ cher and also start to get heal@@ thi@@ er and heal@@ thi@@ er .
so to me , as a public health professor , it &apos;s not strange that all these countries grow so fast now .
we have the high income countries here , with the united states as a leading power ; we have the emerging economies in the middle , which provide a lot of the funding for the ba@@ il@@ out ; and we have the low income countries here .
and we have countries all this way .
and the blue former developing countries are mix@@ ing up with the former industri@@ alized western world .
they are moving to cities , where they also get better assi@@ stance for that .
and in spi@@ te of them having quite a high income , they have a huge number of hiv infected .
it &apos;s similar to the p@@ ell@@ agr@@ a epidemic in miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i in the &apos; 3@@ 0s .
hans rosling : let my dat@@ as@@ et change your mind@@ set
this may not seem to im@@ press , but technological evolution is pro@@ gressi@@ ve , so another 10 , 20,000 years , and ar@@ ma@@ ments technology takes you here .
social structure adap@@ ts to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date this possibility and to har@@ ness this productive potential , so you get cities , you know , and you get all the non-@@ zero-@@ sum games you don &apos;t think about that are being played across the world .
it &apos;s the down@@ side cor@@ relation of their fortun@@ es that will become more and more possible .
it &apos;s when your wel@@ fare condu@@ ces to mine , that i decide , oh yeah , i &apos;m all in fa@@ vor of your wel@@ fare . that &apos;s what &apos;s responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far , and i &apos;m saying we once again have a cor@@ relation of fortun@@ es , and if people respond to it intelli@@ g@@ ently , we will see the development of toler@@ ance and so on -- the nor@@ ms that we need , you know .
there are people who worry about this , and in fact , i , myself , apparently , was den@@ o@@ un@@ ced on national tv a couple of ni@@ ghts ago because of an op@@ -@@ ed i &apos;d written .
unfortunately , i personally do not believe in the mar@@ shall plan .
we need to re@@ frame the challenge that is facing africa , from a challenge of des@@ pair , which is called poverty reduction , to a challenge of hope .
which country is that ?
the fact is no government in the world , with the ex@@ ception of a few , like that of i@@ di am@@ in , can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule .
because they don &apos;t need to talk to their own citizens .
you need we@@ m@@ b@@ ley stadium to host our par@@ li@@ ament .
&quot; not good . &quot;
and i think that &apos;s terri@@ fic . i &apos;m proud of it .
and starting about six years ago , we asked about extremely happy people .
the first life is the pleas@@ ant life and it &apos;s simply , as best we can find it , it &apos;s having as many of the pleas@@ ures as you can , as much positive emotion as you can , and learning the skills -- sa@@ vor@@ ing , mind@@ ful@@ ness -- that am@@ pli@@ fy them , that stre@@ tch them over time and space .
when the first card is played , until 10 days later , the tour@@ nam@@ ent is over , time st@@ ops for len .
i mentioned that for all three kinds of lives , the pleas@@ ant life , the good life , the meaningful life , people are now hard at work on the question , are there things that la@@ st@@ ingly change those lives ?
and this is really what you &apos;re about . and that &apos;s our target vari@@ able .
and it turns out the skills of happiness , the skills of the pleas@@ ant life , the skills of engagement , the skills of meaning , are different from the skills of re@@ lie@@ ving mis@@ ery .
shot straight down , so these are the sha@@ do@@ ws of the cam@@ els .
and he said , &quot; oh , yeah , i remember that too !
and a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le walks up a ri@@ verb@@ ank toward its den .
and most of that growth is not in the cities , but in the slums that surro@@ und them .
photography can also compe@@ l us to con@@ front issues that are potentially dist@@ res@@ sing and contro@@ versi@@ al .
and he said he was never really afraid of this .
the photo director for national geographic , david gri@@ ff@@ in knows the power of photography to connect us to our world . in a talk filled with glori@@ ous images , he talks about how we all use photos to tell our stories .
and , even more importantly , since this is a phot@@ om@@ et@@ ric process that only takes three seconds to capture , we can shoot emi@@ ly in just part of an afternoon , in many different facial poses and facial expres@@ sions .
emi@@ ly : image metri@@ cs is a mark@@ er@@ less , performan@@ ce-@@ driven animation company .
but finally , i got myself involved .
it has also some beautiful pri@@ mates .
but i was from the west , working in the east .
everywhere there has been constant extra@@ ction of miner@@ al , killing animals , the log@@ ging ti@@ m@@ bers and so on .
so we went to meet them .
sorry .
and i succe@@ e@@ ded .
that &apos;s because of the language of g@@ uns .
thank you , thank you .
now this isn &apos;t because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to ou@@ ts@@ our@@ ce war to private companies , but this is what has happened .
imagine that you are the head of a major school system , and someone comes to you with this pro@@ pos@@ al .
all right , what about that ?
but once we see that markets change the character of goods , we have to debate among ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods .
they &apos;re demo@@ graphics , education , debt and ine@@ quality .
you &apos;ll notice that in 18@@ 9@@ 1 , over on the left , we were at about 5,000 dollars .
so that brings us down to 0.@@ 8 .
those hor@@ ses also ate up fully one quarter of american agricultural land .
option a is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago .
and others , like my mother , would say that i get my material from past lives .
there was a reason for everything .
and this happens constantly in the writing .
and all of us in life , when we see a situation , we have a response .
i was thinking that i shouldn &apos;t go because somebody said , if i did , it would show that i appro@@ ved of the military regime there .
what are things that you get from the universe that you can &apos;t really explain ?
and i saw this beautiful place . i knew i wanted to come back .
i also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about lu@@ ck , and fa@@ te , and co@@ inci@@ den@@ ces and accidents , god &apos;s will , and the synchr@@ ony of mysteri@@ ous forces -- i will come to some notion of what that is , how we create .
that the success of sli@@ ced bread , like the success of almost everything we &apos;ve been talking about at this conference , is not always about what the patent is like , or what the factory is like -- it &apos;s about can you get your idea to spread , or not .
the brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to inter@@ rupt me in one year .
but if the cow was pur@@ ple -- isn &apos;t that a great special effect ?
this guy , li@@ on@@ el po@@ il@@ ane , the most famous bak@@ er in the world -- he died two and a half months ago , and he was a hero of mine and a de@@ ar friend .
there &apos;s a hot sauce ot@@ ak@@ u , but there &apos;s no mu@@ star@@ d ot@@ ak@@ u .
they got this way by being remarkable , sometimes a little too remarkable .
milk , milk , milk , milk , milk -- not milk .
two years ago , i was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition com@@ memor@@ ating 100 years of islamic art in europe .
a group of artists decided to paint a life-@@ size tank on a wall . it &apos;s one to one .
so a lot of economists look at dec@@ lin@@ ing population and expect to see stag@@ nation , maybe depression .
and instead , they &apos;ll be planning for the future and starting to build the 2@@ 2@@ nd century en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
they only need 12 days from the moment they &apos;re born until they &apos;re on their own .
this was a small net that was being used in mexico to catch shrimp , but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world .
and with this photograph of a beautiful 15@@ -@@ feet , probably 14@@ -@@ feet , i guess , female tiger shark , i sort of think i got to that goal , where she was swimming with these little bar@@ jac@@ ks off her nose , and my stro@@ be created a shadow on her face .
these are animals whose lin@@ e@@ age dates back about 100 million years .
they hold on to them , and it eventually kill@@ s them .
little blue co@@ d swimming in for a d@@ ash of color .
it &apos;s not good .
still , four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people .
you also know how much labor is needed .
so how to break that cycle ?
so , just like nature , we also grow fast plan@@ ting trees and underneath that , we grow the slo@@ wer growing , pri@@ mar@@ y-@@ grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can opti@@ m@@ ally use that light . then , what is just as important : get the right f@@ ung@@ i in there that will grow into those leaves , bring back the nutri@@ ents to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that lea@@ f within 24 hours .
and that &apos;s green . if you look from the tower -- this is when we start attac@@ king the grass .
if you look at rain@@ fall , it was already up 20 percent at that time .
you also have to make sure that it is very difficult to cor@@ rupt -- that it &apos;s transparent .
do you see how there &apos;s three pe@@ aks to the yellow s@@ ine wave ?
i have a two-@@ year-old daughter who &apos;s the best thing ever .
and so i guess , one , the gut re@@ actions a little bit wrong sometimes , and two , it does not look like as expected .
he &apos;s a very dem@@ anding person .
-- that &apos;s why when we &apos;re talking about sustainability , it &apos;s not enough , green buildings .
try to understand the se@@ ctors in the city that could play different ro@@ les during the 24 hours .
so when you start -- and we cannot be so pre@@ po@@ tent on having all the answers -- it &apos;s important starting and having the contribu@@ tion from people , and they could teach you if you &apos;re not in the right track .
well , i think it &apos;s a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they &apos;re op@@ posing each other but in fact they share a common set of assu@@ mp@@ tions .
now , whenever somebody tells me that , i think , you want to see spiritu@@ ality move something ?
the famous mind-@@ body problem is that simple .
i gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand , but how is that possible ?
is that absolute , like force and mass and gravi@@ tational attra@@ ction ?
so it &apos;s an obvious mistake . why did they make the mistake ?
and i mean by this -- and you may say , by the way , &quot; look , i &apos;m good .
you have to go looking for them , they &apos;re not just lying around on the surface .
i love that word , &quot; dis@@ en@@ thr@@ all . &quot;
as she says , &quot; it &apos;s a single function device . &quot;
he said , &quot; but i wanted to be a fire@@ man . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ve achieved nothing -- com@@ mit .
if you &apos;re doing something that doesn &apos;t reson@@ ate with your spirit , five minutes feels like an hour .
and he says , &quot; i &apos;ve got something else , but it may not be for you . &quot;
like the ver@@ b &quot; to wed &quot; that you see here has become regular .
and i think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that .
but i realized that what i really needed to know i couldn &apos;t get from training cour@@ ses .
and no one got killed .
but anger as an engine -- in an engine -- is powerful .
and i think that the u.s. military is finally beginning to get this .
and it &apos;s being used by young people and older people everywhere , because it works and it &apos;s effective .
can we all just close our eyes for a minute ?
what &apos;s all the f@@ uss about ?
can we use , in a way , a body as an empty cat@@ aly@@ st for a kind of empathy with the experience of spac@@ e-@@ time as it is lived , as i am standing here in front of you trying to feel and make a connection in this spac@@ e-@@ time that we are sharing , can we use , at it were , the memory of a body , of a human space in space to cat@@ aly@@ ze an experience , again , fir@@ sth@@ and experience , of element@@ al time .
you are now consciousness without an object , fre@@ ed from the dimension@@ ful and measured way in which life links us to the ob@@ li@@ g@@ atory .
i once told a fortune magazine writer that some@@ day people like me would go to jail .
in the new industrial revolution extra@@ ctive must be re@@ placed by renew@@ able ; linear by cy@@ cli@@ cal ; fossil fuel energy by renew@@ able energy , sunlight ; wa@@ ste@@ ful by wa@@ ste@@ -@@ free ; and ab@@ u@@ sive by ben@@ ig@@ n ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
we &apos;ve set 20@@ 20 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the sum@@ mit of mo@@ unt sustainability .
that a is a capital a , suggest@@ ing that aff@@ lu@@ ence is an end in itself .
here is what gl@@ en@@ n wrote . and here is that person , most at risk .
depending on who you read , an arts organization or an artist , who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket bu@@ yer , now compe@@ tes with between three and 5,000 different marketing messages a typical citi@@ zen sees every single day .
how are they enti@@ t@@ led to practice ?
today &apos;s per@@ form@@ ers , like r@@ ho@@ des@@ sa jones , work in women &apos;s pris@@ ons , helping women prison@@ ers artic@@ u@@ late the pain of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , while today &apos;s play@@ wri@@ ghts and direc@@ tors work with you@@ th gan@@ gs to find alterna@@ te chan@@ nels to violence and more and more and more .
it &apos;s by ast@@ or pi@@ a@@ zz@@ oll@@ a , an ar@@ gent@@ ine com@@ pos@@ er .
and mr. ross said , &quot; you &apos;re too smart to die and i don &apos;t want it on my con@@ science , so i &apos;m leaving this school and i &apos;m taking you with me . &quot;
well , i think that wel@@ fare mothers and at@@ -@@ risk kids and ex@@ -@@ steel workers deser@@ ve a foun@@ tain in their life .
they did all right in the ket@@ ch@@ up business .
these are examples of the food that wel@@ fare mothers are doing after six months in the training program .
and this is the arts program i started in 196@@ 8 .
and i said , &quot; bill , i want to hire you , man .
and i said , &quot; you &apos;re in the computer business , is that right ? &quot;
and that worked out all right .
and i &apos;m very pleas@@ ed to tell you that the building &apos;s done .
and the reason this picture &apos;s in here is i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics sum@@ mit , and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me .
thanks very much , and give me your card and some@@ time we &apos;ll talk . &quot;
and i said , &quot; if i can follow that music , i &apos;ll get out into the sunlight and i &apos;ll be ok .
it &apos;s the development of a pros@@ thetic device for treating blin@@ dness .
and so the en@@ co@@ der does just what i was saying : it mi@@ mi@@ cs the actions of the fron@@ t-@@ end circu@@ it@@ ry -- so it takes images in and conver@@ ts them into the retin@@ a &apos;s code .
so you can see that it &apos;s pretty limited , and because the fir@@ ing patterns aren &apos;t in the right code , they &apos;re very limited in what they can tell you about what &apos;s out there . so you can see that there &apos;s something there , but it &apos;s not so clear what that something is , and this just sort of circles back to what i was saying in the beginning , that with the standard method , patients can see high-@@ contrast ed@@ ges , they can see light , but it doesn &apos;t easily go further than that . so what was the image ? it was a baby &apos;s face .
there is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do , but you have 10 trillion bacteri@@ al cells in you or on you at any moment in your life .
we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room , and this is what we see .
but then if you think about it , the squ@@ id has this terrible problem because it &apos;s got this dying , thick culture of bacteria and it can &apos;t susta@@ in that .
this is the word that it talks with .
then again we turn to chemistry , and we figured out what this gener@@ ic molecule is -- that was the pink o@@ v@@ als on my last slide , this is it .
we &apos;ve taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we &apos;ve made an@@ tag@@ oni@@ sts of the inter@@ species communication system .
it &apos;s not like your heart cells and your ki@@ dney cells get all mix@@ ed up every day , and that &apos;s because there &apos;s all of this chemistry going on , these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is , and what their tasks should be .
lying just bene@@ ath the surface of those arguments , with passi@@ ons ra@@ ging on all sides , are big questions of moral philosophy , big questions of justice .
but here &apos;s a harder question .
he had a bad leg , a cir@@ cul@@ atory problem , that made it very painful for him to walk the course .
charlie says -- we &apos;ll get charlie a micro@@ phone in case someone wants to rep@@ ly .
and they brought in jack ni@@ ck@@ l@@ aus and ar@@ n@@ old pal@@ mer .
if we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are mer@@ ely arb@@ it@@ r@@ ary , rather than designed to call forth the virtu@@ es and the excell@@ ences that we think are worthy of admi@@ ring , we wouldn &apos;t care about the outcome of the game .
there is a tenden@@ cy to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics , that &apos;s a reci@@ pe for dis@@ agre@@ ement , and for that matter , a reci@@ pe for in@@ toler@@ ance and co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
democracy thri@@ ves on civil debate , michael san@@ del says -- but we &apos;re sh@@ am@@ efully out of practice . he leads a fun re@@ fres@@ her , with ted@@ sters spar@@ ring over a recent su@@ pre@@ me court case whose outcome reve@@ als the critical ingre@@ dient in justice .
it &apos;s a traditional part of the way of life , and we should be allowed to carry on doing it .
what &apos;s not fine is for us to make that choice on be@@ half of the future .
basically , ger@@ ont@@ ology is a fine approach in the end , but it is not an approach whose time has come when we &apos;re talking about intervention .
because , you know , most people , when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more , they think that i &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to invent therap@@ ies in the next few decades that are so th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly elimin@@ ating aging that those therap@@ ies will let us live to 1,000 or more .
and thir@@ dly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ?
the engineering approach does not interven@@ e in any processes .
i haven &apos;t got time to go through them at all , but my conclusion is that , if we can actually get su@@ itable funding for this , then we can probably develop robust mouse re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation in only 10 years , but we do need to get serious about it .
however , as far as i know , all the species have evolved to actually die , so when cells divide , the tel@@ om@@ er@@ ase get shor@@ ter , and eventually species die .
au@@ bre@@ y de gre@@ y : a ro@@ ad@@ map to end aging
so let me share with you our values .
have you seen the incredible ur@@ ge out there to re@@ build the very things that failed us ?
the final thought i want to leave with you is that i &apos;m fed up with this ty@@ ran@@ ny of either / or choices in life -- either it &apos;s men or it &apos;s women .
and probably the best example we have here in america is port@@ land , or@@ eg@@ on .
we have the first generation of children in america who are predi@@ cted to live shor@@ ter lives than their parents .
we figure it &apos;s a natural risk of being on the road .
the carbon ma@@ pping of america , where is the co2 being em@@ it@@ ted , for many years only ham@@ mer@@ ed this argument in more stron@@ g@@ ly .
but what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more , something that would be better than what we have right now ?
in the case of the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine , regre@@ tt@@ ably , we shot every one that we saw . we s@@ laugh@@ tered them .
so we thought , let &apos;s give it a go .
in those fossil rocks are some amazing animals .
but immediately , the government said , that &apos;s it , let &apos;s get rid of them , and they paid people to s@@ lau@@ ghter every one that they saw .
and then the tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil is going to pop a th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine out the south end .
at any rate , he led us down this bush track , and there , right where he remember@@ ed , was the hut , and te@@ ars came into his eyes .
so i thought that what may be useful is to remind us of some of the things that have gone on here , and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away , and take forward and work on .
it &apos;s important that we build this platform , that we have the president , ki@@ k@@ we@@ te , and others of our leaders who are saying , &quot; look , we must do something different . &quot;
so now we have this platform we can build on .
i want to tell you a little story .
i was scared because i knew her life depen@@ ded on my getting to this woman .
these are people who are productive ag@@ ents in the economy .
now we talk about the world bank , im@@ f , and accoun@@ t@@ ability , all that and the e@@ u .
and we don &apos;t do it because there are so many of us . we don &apos;t coordin@@ ate .
but it can be cat@@ aly@@ tic . and if we fail to use it as cat@@ aly@@ tic , we would have failed .
but there are people -- women -- creating jobs .
i &apos;m going to start off by playing a video for you .
i think that neuro@@ scientists have many more questions than answers , and i myself , i &apos;m not going to give you many answers today , just ask a lot of questions .
and so the experiment really re@@ sts on the following : what happens in the brain during something that &apos;s memor@@ ized and over@@ -@@ learned , and what happens in the brain during something that is spon@@ taneously generated , or improvis@@ ed , in a way that &apos;s mat@@ ched motor@@ ically and in terms of lo@@ wer@@ -@@ level sensory motor features ?
but we have this combination of an area that &apos;s thought to be involved in self-@@ monit@@ oring , turning off , and this area that &apos;s thought to be auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal , or self-@@ expres@@ sive , turning on .
and so what you &apos;re seeing here -- and i &apos;m doing a car@@ din@@ al s@@ in in science , which is to show you pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary data .
this is the control condition . this is what they memor@@ ized .
but we want to get at the root of what is creative genius , neuro@@ logi@@ cally , and i think , with these methods , we &apos;re getting close to being there .
and it &apos;s time for our mathematics curricul@@ um to change from analo@@ g to digital , from the more classi@@ cal , continu@@ ous mathematics , to the more modern , dis@@ crete mathematics -- the mathematics of un@@ certainty , of random@@ ness , of data -- that being probability and statistics .
now this is quite time consum@@ ing and isn &apos;t the most comfortable process .
but maintain that thought for the entire du@@ ration of the eight seconds .
so i &apos;d like to show you a few examples , because there are many possible applications for this new interface .
vaccin@@ ation is one of the key techniques in public health , a fantastic thing .
two hundred million people a year .
and if you look through the eye , or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye , in fact , you may be able to do this directly , without drawing any blood at all , or through your na@@ il be@@ ds .
how can you tell ?
so we thought , &quot; well , we &apos;ve done all these things that are focused on the pl@@ as@@ modi@@ um , the parasi@@ te involved .
mosqu@@ it@@ oes only drink blood to lay eggs .
so this system that was built for ted is here to illu@@ strate that it is techni@@ cally possible to actually deplo@@ y a system like this , and we &apos;re looking very hard at how to make it highly co@@ st-@@ effective to use in places like africa and other parts of the world .
i basically take it , prepare it , and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it .
will they out@@ live me ? they probably might .
a couple of wor@@ mer@@ ies in there too .
in the can@@ al , which is just outside the restaurant , there is hundreds of meters of co@@ il pi@@ ping .
and no one &apos;s doing that just yet .
the purpose of this project is , one : i hate not remember@@ ing things that i &apos;ve done in the past .
it &apos;s not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we &apos;re doing awesome things .
eventually , these be@@ a@@ sts are going to live in her@@ ds on the be@@ ach@@ es .
in fact , it &apos;s a new invention of the wheel .
so as soon it has been to the sea , it changes the pattern of zer@@ oes and ones here , and it knows always where it is on the beach . so it &apos;s very simple brain .
we decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route , even though nobody had been there before , to see if we could synthes@@ ize a bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some so we could actually v@@ ary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life .
and we knew , once that worked , that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosom@@ es to do the same with those .
and we found that 10 out of the 11 10@@ 0,@@ 000-@@ base pair pieces we synthes@@ ized were completely accurate and com@@ pati@@ ble with a life-@@ forming sequence .
so we won &apos;t give the rest of the code , but we will give the three quot@@ ations .
also , at synthetic genom@@ ics , we &apos;ve been working on major environmental issues .
i &apos;d set aside three weeks for this project , and that , i think , is what is meant by &quot; hu@@ br@@ is &quot; -- -- because it turned out to be three months .
&quot; some of these ver@@ ses are defini@@ te in meaning , &quot; it says , &quot; and others are ambi@@ gu@@ ous . &quot;
and in particular , how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization .
so every year , on the same day -- and it &apos;s a mystery exactly how that happens -- each colony sen@@ ds out its virg@@ in , un@@ mated que@@ ens with wings , and the males , and they all fly to a common place . and they mate .
and it &apos;s when they reach this stable size , in numbers of ants , that they start to re@@ produce .
so that &apos;s what the mi@@ dden workers do .
and then eventually they get rec@@ ru@@ ited to join this ex@@ teri@@ or work@@ force .
so , if i change the numbers performing one task , it changes the numbers performing another .
it &apos;s not due to the experience of older , wis@@ er ants .
this is taken through a fiber op@@ tics microscope . it &apos;s down inside the nest .
so this is the kind of rule that , as the colony develop@@ s and gets older and larger , will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one .
and it continues .
the slide you &apos;re looking at here is 1990 to 20@@ 40 .
it &apos;s 25 percent cle@@ aner than oil .
that &apos;s your concern .
t@@ b@@ p : that &apos;s what happened .
but if that &apos;s it and that becomes the reason that renew@@ ables don &apos;t get invest@@ ed in , then , long-term , we &apos;re scre@@ wed anyway , right ?
and now i think re@@ form@@ ers are safe .
all right , so you don &apos;t support a carbon tax of any kind or a price on carbon .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people who will want to engage with you .
and the parall@@ els between the gold rush and the internet rush continue very stron@@ g@@ ly .
and they wouldn &apos;t let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn &apos;t come back .
now , here &apos;s where our analog@@ y with the gold rush starts to diver@@ ge , and i think rather sever@@ ely .
and they &apos;re te@@ aring up all the streets .
i don &apos;t know why . but i thought , you know , sometimes it &apos;s just not the right time for an invention ; maybe it &apos;s time to give this one another shot .
so you know , when you were done with it , you uns@@ cre@@ wed it .
and they were really happy that the guy had a speak@@ er@@ phone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there .
so , i &apos;m going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language , and so it &apos;s not going to sound as warm and fu@@ zz@@ y as your average compassion talk .
biologists call that &quot; reci@@ pro@@ cal al@@ tru@@ ism . &quot; ok .
we say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison .
so , what do those terms mean ?
and the story of globalization is largely a story of non-@@ zero-@@ sum@@ ness .
and politicians can be aware , and should be aware that , when people around the world are looking at them , are looking at their nation and picking up their cu@@ es for whether they are in a zero-@@ sum or a non-@@ zero-@@ sum relationship with a nation -- like , say , america , or any other nation -- human psychology is such that they use cu@@ es like : do we feel we &apos;re being respe@@ cted ?
and it &apos;s going to take real work to change that .
and when her carbon cop@@ ied questi@@ on@@ na@@ ire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jum@@ ped out with the statisti@@ cal clar@@ ity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of cr@@ un@@ ching the data in order to dis@@ prove her .
afraid of the conflict that that would provo@@ ke , afraid to get em@@ bro@@ iled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bo@@ und to lose .
and when he dar@@ ed to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
so , let me quickly try and tell you why i thought that and how i went about it .
and let me quickly tell you some cru@@ cial experiment that was able to actually show this .
we want to make this a structure , and ask the question , how do the cells do that ?
i said , if it &apos;s true that architecture is dominant , architecture re@@ stor@@ ed to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it &apos;s normal .
it has taken many years , but it has been very re@@ war@@ ding .
it &apos;s called &quot; among the school children . &quot;
now , of course , not all de@@ ception hits the news .
let &apos;s start with the bu@@ t@@ lers . here &apos;s an example of one : &quot; on my way . &quot; anybody ever written , &quot; on my way ? &quot;
now this so@@ ck pu@@ p@@ pet stuff isn &apos;t actually that new .
well , one study tested this by exam@@ ining people &apos;s person@@ alities .
it &apos;s a very old literature by now , it &apos;s coming up on 50 years .
it looks like almost every single person here recorded something .
all right , so why do i care about this ?
because in the digital age we live in now , in the net@@ worked age , we are all leaving a record .
because we ultimately questi@@ oned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life , how you want to connect to information .
but we &apos;ve come a long way .
because i feel like , you know , there are so many images out there , so many clothes out there .
it &apos;s rarely color that i find in nature , although , you know , ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed next to artificial color , natural color is so beautiful .
you know , homosexu@@ ality , right ?
and many of my friends were bal@@ let dan@@ cers .
and that was a very , very , very big part of my process .
because just because if you &apos;re fabul@@ ously rich , and fabul@@ ously famous , does that mean you shouldn &apos;t have kids , because you know they &apos;re going to end up getting mess@@ ed up ?
like i say , oh , you know , would you serve a ro@@ tten chicken ?
let me tell you something interesting .
have you ever wondered why extre@@ mis@@ m seems to have been on the rise in musli@@ m-@@ majority countries over the course of the last decade ?
and my story , my personal story , is truly evidence for the age of behavior that i &apos;m attemp@@ ting to el@@ abor@@ ate upon here .
because the internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world .
it &apos;s com@@ pris@@ ed of ideas and narra@@ tives and sym@@ b@@ ols and leaders .
that we have a h@@ es@@ itation in es@@ po@@ using the univers@@ ality of democratic culture because we are associ@@ ating that -- we associ@@ ate belie@@ ving in the univers@@ ality of our values -- with extre@@ mi@@ sts .
neo@@ conserva@@ tis@@ m had the philosophy that you go in with a sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ led approach to im@@ pose democratic values from the top down .
that doesn &apos;t guaran@@ tee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values .
it &apos;s when everybody is able to take them for granted .
whereas the phone gave us the one-@@ to-@@ one pattern , and television , radio , maga@@ zin@@ es , books , gave us the one-@@ to-@@ many pattern , the internet gives us the man@@ y-@@ to-@@ many pattern .
twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the us ge@@ ological survey had anything up online for anybody to read .
that was enough of citi@@ zen media .
we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global , social , ubi@@ quit@@ ous and cheap .
and he said essentially , &quot; i have considered the issue .
it &apos;s 2@@ 9@@ ,@@ 0@@ 35 feet high .
there were three other expedi@@ tions on the mountain , an american team , a new ze@@ al@@ and team and an ima@@ x team .
and that &apos;s because everest is so high , it &apos;s in the jet stream , and win@@ ds are constantly sc@@ our@@ ing the face , so no snow gets to accu@@ mu@@ late .
but what happened that year was the wind suddenly and un@@ expec@@ ted@@ ly picked up .
rob hall , we heard by radio , was up here , at this point in the storm with dou@@ g han@@ sen .
the only supp@@ lies i had at that al@@ titude were two plastic bags with pr@@ el@@ o@@ aded sy@@ ring@@ es of pain@@ killer and stero@@ ids .
some of them were hypo@@ ther@@ mic , some of them were fro@@ st@@ bitten , some were both .
and bec@@ k told me that story very quie@@ tly , but i was absolutely stun@@ ned by it .
you go on to the next scan , but , in bec@@ k &apos;s case , you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again .
a heli@@ cop@@ ter came in at 2@@ 1,000 feet and carried out the highest heli@@ cop@@ ter rescu@@ e in history .
and i looked at india and said , really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on india .
only if the people have education , they have roads to go to work , they have lights to study at night -- only in those cases can you really get the benefit of a demo@@ graphic divi@@ den@@ d .
again , after having lived for more than 200 years under the east india company and under im@@ peri@@ al rule , indi@@ ans had a very natural reaction towards globalization belie@@ ving it was a form of im@@ peri@@ alism .
but today i believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to imple@@ ment .
because of the historical indian background , in the ca@@ ste system , and because of the fact that there have been many people who have been left out in the cold , a lot of the politics is about how to make sure that we &apos;ll address that .
the second thing is , the health issue .
you know if you look at the development in the west over 200 years , the average growth may have been about two percent .
and because of the rain until four o &apos;@@ clock in the afternoon , nobody went to the poll@@ ing stations .
and i &apos;ll start with what went right .
remember , until the 197@@ 0s , the spread of democracy has always been ac@@ compan@@ ied by the decline of ine@@ quality .
the content doesn &apos;t matter anymore , the problem is the media .
and the public was extremely all for it .
now , the social impact bond is simply saying , if we can get the government to agree , that we can create a contract where they only pay if it worked .
society w@@ ins : fewer cri@@ mes , fewer victims .
the second piece it brings is ri@@ g@@ or .
ge@@ e , that &apos;s s@@ well . i guess you &apos;re just my fat@@ al attra@@ c@@ tion-@@ ie . you &apos;re my c@@ lon@@ ie . thank you .
i go , &quot; i don &apos;t know where we &apos;re going . &quot;
&quot; hab@@ i@@ bi , it &apos;s so hot . just come here for a second . say hello .
even if i &apos;m there with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; gre@@ et@@ ings , jack . sal@@ u@@ tations , jack . &quot;
thank you very much , ted@@ x .
i got way too much time on my hands .
there is the inside of our lab . we haven &apos;t shown this before .
look around the room : cha@@ irs , wood , everything around us has to change or we &apos;re not going to li@@ ck this problem .
so you see , it &apos;s all in@@ t@@ act , completely transparent .
it wasn &apos;t until the invention of the m@@ r and really the integration of m@@ r with focused ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und that we could get the feedback -- both the anatom@@ ical and the physi@@ ological in order to have a completely non@@ invasi@@ ve , clo@@ se@@ d-@@ loop sur@@ gical proce@@ d@@ ure .
the only hand@@ work the physi@@ cian does here is moving a mouse .
and you have to understand what is in people &apos;s mind when they are willing to take the risk .
he had meta@@ st@@ ases in his right bu@@ t@@ to@@ ck , and he couldn &apos;t sit even with medi@@ cation .
and it &apos;s not just because of regu@@ lation ; it &apos;s because of the amount of money needed under the current evi@@ den@@ ce-@@ based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen .
so in conclusion , i &apos;d like to leave you with actually four messages .
the only thing that they can &apos;t copy is the actual tra@@ de@@ mark lab@@ el within that piece of appar@@ el .
this we@@ dding dress here is actually made of spor@@ ks , and this dress is actually made of al@@ umin@@ um .
and this is a good thing . we need lots of options .
okay , we &apos;ll move on .
are ni@@ ke t-@@ shir@@ ts that are almost identical to one another .
and some of these industries may seem sort of mar@@ g@@ in@@ al to you , but these are the gross sales for low i.@@ p@@ . industries , industries with very little copyright protection , and there &apos;s the gross sales of films and books .
and these things , because we can copy and trans@@ mit them so easily , actually circu@@ late within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically in@@ stan@@ ti@@ ated objects .
it wasn &apos;t until later , when i was actually back home in new york that i got the idea for the project .
so that white material that you see in between the bar@@ k and the wood is the my@@ ce@@ li@@ al felt of the fun@@ gu@@ s , slowly stran@@ gling the tree to death by pre@@ venting the flow of water and nutri@@ ents .
and aside from coral , the answer is no .
and it actually never she@@ ds those leaves , so it also be@@ ars the distin@@ ction of having the lon@@ gest leaves in the plant kingdom .
but what &apos;s unique about it is that it &apos;s doing dna repair below free@@ zing .
so , every pop@@ corn production begins with the video , and so i &apos;ve made a short , 20-@@ second clip using a new@@ sc@@ aster temp@@ late that we use in work@@ shops .
thank you .
the men that carried that attack out were ar@@ med with ak@@ -@@ 4@@ 7@@ s , explo@@ si@@ ves and hand gren@@ a@@ des .
&quot; yes , yes , yes , &quot; came the answers .
moving forward , the internet allowed things to scale even more .
the u@@ k i know has some very stri@@ ct fire@@ arms laws .
it &apos;s a great challenge for them .
actually , it &apos;s a bit more complex than that , and there are no magic bul@@ lets .
i can as@@ sure you that the terrori@@ sts and criminals are .
will i not make enough money ?
and i &apos;ve been touched by cam@@ bo@@ dian women -- beautiful women , women who held the tradition of the classi@@ cal dance in cam@@ bo@@ dia .
i &apos;ve heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adoles@@ cent male .
we &apos;ve invest@@ ed more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies , and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars into these for@@ gotten markets .
he said , &quot; long story .
and he said to me at the end of his year , &quot; jac@@ qu@@ eline , it was so hum@@ bling , because i thought as a farmer and as an african i would understand how to tran@@ sc@@ end culture .
is this the face of leonardo da vin@@ c@@ i or isn &apos;t it ?
before we go into these faces , i should explain why i have some right to talk about them .
it &apos;s only proper that you here at ted hear and see it first .
then i took that pad . i want to see that . what is inside it ?
they also ref@@ used . finally , i decide , use san@@ it@@ ary pad myself .
that &apos;s why i am giving this machine only in rural india , for rural women , because in india , &#91; you &apos;ll be &#93; surprised , only two percent of women are using san@@ it@@ ary pa@@ ds . the rest , they &apos;re using a ra@@ g cl@@ oth , a lea@@ f , hus@@ k , &#91; saw &#93; dust , everything except san@@ it@@ ary pa@@ ds .
like that , i never ch@@ ased ma@@ hal@@ ak@@ sh@@ m@@ i .
what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world , and show me just how fragi@@ le the world is .
fresh water free@@ zes at zero .
i was hyper@@ venti@@ l@@ ating so much , and within seconds my hands were num@@ b .
and his hands were so bad@@ ly fro@@ st@@ bitten that he had to return to england .
i had never seen black water before .
but was it worth it ? yes , absolutely it was .
and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff .
this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems .
what &apos;s different is how the molecules are put together .
it &apos;s because , well , thousands of years ago , people invented ideas -- they had ideas , innovations , technology -- and the stone age ended , not because we ran out of st@@ ones .
well , they have other , little bit of advantage , but they also have some dis@@ advan@@ tages , but the one thing they or we have is that we &apos;ve reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out .
and she said , &quot; well , something very weird was happening .
so , you know , you want energy , you want the life force , but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing .
she was sort of ad@@ ored on the right the way ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ v@@ elt was on the left .
and she looked at me , and it was like the successful arm@@ -@@ w@@ rest@@ le , and then , after that , she deli@@ vered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like .
so the question is : what is the key that &apos;s going to allow this to proce@@ ed ?
at the time that i pro@@ posed to her that -- by the way , i would have pro@@ posed to her ; she was extraordinary -- but pro@@ posed to her that she come on .
and secondly , she had better be , although she did dance for a while , a ch@@ ore@@ ograph@@ er because then her looks didn &apos;t matter .
so this seemed like a problem that we could do something about .
and i have to ask the question -- v@@ c &apos;s always ask , &quot; sir , what is your business , and who is your custom@@ er ? &quot;
how is this a hard problem ?
they &apos;ve treated 50,000 kids in vietnam with this technology .
you think it &apos;s funny .
because there is this as@@ ym@@ me@@ try , which creates , basically , fail@@ ing governance .
no , we are talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the s@@ wis@@ s bank accoun@@ ts , on the bank accoun@@ ts of lie@@ chten@@ stein , of the president &apos;s mini@@ sters , the high offi@@ ci@@ als in the par@@ a-@@ stat@@ al se@@ ctors .
we had here in berlin , at the as@@ pen institute on the wan@@ n@@ see , we had s@@ essi@@ ons with about 20 cap@@ tains of industry , and we discus@@ sed with them what to do about international bri@@ ber@@ y .
this is , under german law , allowed , and the members of our par@@ li@@ ament don &apos;t want to change this , and this is why they can &apos;t sign the u.n. conven@@ tion against foreign bri@@ ber@@ y -- one of they very , very few countries which is pre@@ ach@@ ing honest@@ y and good governance everywhere in the world , but not able to rati@@ fy the conven@@ tion , which we managed to get on the books with about 1@@ 60 countries all over the world .
instead , i &apos;m thinking about that cup of coffee i desper@@ ately need to wake me up .
there are three paintings i &apos;m going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them .
for one thing , in du@@ tch painting of the time , if a woman &apos;s mouth was open , it was indi@@ cating sexual avail@@ ability .
so clearly , her clothes were l@@ ent to various different women .
i &apos;m thinking of an older version of himself .
and i thought , if i &apos;m going to make a story , what &apos;s the last thing i &apos;m going to put in there ?
i know , i could barely u@@ tter them .
then came b@@ ollywood .
here i can tell a story of africans making movies like i do , and actually i felt this was an inspiration for me .
they can afford to watch their &quot; robo@@ co@@ p &quot; and whatever .
but we can do something too .
robo@@ ger anima@@ du : in big countries , when they do the movies , they have all these things in place .
and so it &apos;s a very , very important thing for them , and for their audi@@ ences .
so this is what i really think .
so it &apos;s safe to say that there are 2,000 films .
i &apos;m almost like a crazy ev@@ ange@@ li@@ cal .
and jonathan jones is making it happen .
even in the 193@@ 0s , my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the cu@@ st@@ oms offic@@ ers that decided they were not art .
i &apos;ve never made it into a planet , but that &apos;s it .
we have street fi@@ ghter ii , because mar@@ tial arts are good .
the real core issue of interaction design is behavior .
and it &apos;s too long to explain the ac@@ quisi@@ tion , but if you want to go on the mom@@ a blog , there &apos;s a long post where i explain why it &apos;s such a great example of design .
and we continue to work with this cli@@ ent .
i was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed .
and when i got there , everything was perfect -- except the tail .
p for pal@@ la@@ di@@ o .
then jay chi@@ at asked me to do this building on this funny lot in ven@@ ice , and i started with this three-@@ piece thing , and you entered in the middle .
i mean , it &apos;s kind of a tri@@ te thing to say , but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the caf@@ e@@ teri@@ a would be , where the people would come and where the people working would interact .
and he put these two brid@@ ges with pink guar@@ dra@@ ils on it .
and we started with the stream and built the house along the stream -- dam@@ med it up to make a lake .
i keep trying to make it work .
and a long time ago , about &apos; 8@@ 2 or something , after my house -- i designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pa@@ vili@@ ons around a cour@@ ty@@ ard -- and the ow@@ ner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left .
this is the bedro@@ om .
this is in paris , along the seine .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
and i don &apos;t gave good slides to show -- it &apos;s just been comple@@ ted -- but this piece here is this building , and these pieces here and here .
but everybody liked these forms and liked the space , and so that &apos;s one of the problems of a competition .
i just stuck it on there .
before he was a le@@ gend , architect frank ge@@ hr@@ y takes a whist@@ le@@ stop tour of his early work , from his house in ven@@ ice beach to the american center in paris , which was under construction when he gave this talk .
you &apos;ll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree , cut it down and make char@@ coal out of it .
after some time , after setting it on fire , you se@@ al it to restri@@ ct the oxygen that goes into the kil@@ n , and then you end up with this car@@ bon@@ ized material here .
so we went back to mit , we took out the in@@ str@@ on machine , and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to com@@ press a bri@@ qu@@ ette to the level that you actually are getting impro@@ ved performance out of it ?
people can make their own cooking fuel from waste products .
we need to work with the people in these communities , and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems . that &apos;s the best way to do it .
but also imagine if they were filled with solid bone -- our head would be dead weight , we wouldn &apos;t be able to hold it er@@ e@@ ct , we wouldn &apos;t be able to look at the world around us .
she &apos;s also in danger , when she dama@@ ges this , of ble@@ eding prof@@ us@@ ely .
she wasn &apos;t miser@@ able at all .
i don &apos;t say he over@@ came this ; he didn &apos;t overcome it .
if you do cos@@ me@@ tic surgery , patients are often less happy .
so we &apos;ve talked about the static face and jud@@ ging the static face , but actually , we &apos;re more comfortable with jud@@ ging the moving face .
so with modern technology , we used computers to make models .
just imagine , i can make a bi@@ ologi@@ call@@ y-@@ degra@@ d@@ able temp@@ late .
and i &apos;ll tell you why we need to change it , but we absolutely have to change it .
we are feeding our kids antibio@@ tics in bee@@ f and other animal protein every day .
what goes in is what we are .
it &apos;s because of the way the government commodi@@ fi@@ es food , and the cheap corn and cheap so@@ y that are pus@@ hed into our food supply that makes these non-@@ nutri@@ ent foods really , really cheap .
we really have to teach children that chicken is not a gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
they also may be growing them . and we serve them in the caf@@ e@@ teri@@ as .
i work with private companies who are willing to do r &amp; amp ; d with me , who are willing to do distribution for me , who are really willing to work to go into schools .
but we really have to educ@@ ate .
now i don &apos;t know about you , but i go to star@@ bucks and pe@@ te &apos;s and places like that , and vent@@ i lat@@ te in san francisco is five dollars .
that &apos;s part of you up there .
and i get ho@@ ots of der@@ ision and c@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and grow@@ ls because they think , &quot; that &apos;s impossible ! you can &apos;t explain consciousness . &quot;
now , this nice picture shows a thou@@ ght-@@ balloon , a thou@@ ght-@@ bubble .
so this is the problem . so i have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won &apos;t like , for the same reason that you don &apos;t like to see a magic trick explained to you .
we &apos;re looking for a bac@@ ker .
and i noticed that on the bridge there , there &apos;s a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge .
how many of you ro@@ t@@ ated the one on the right ? ok .
as a cu@@ be , on a black background , as seen through a piece of s@@ wis@@ s che@@ ese .
so now we &apos;re going to be subjects in the experiment .
what i wanted to show you is that scientists , using their fro@@ m-@@ the-@@ outside , thir@@ d-@@ person methods , can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of , and that , in fact , you &apos;re not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are .
they &apos;re essentially , to a point , attemp@@ ts at planning what other people should do , planning their life for them .
now , that &apos;s also wrong , because traffic happens to be a non@@ linear phenomenon , meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity thres@@ hold then con@@ ge@@ stion starts to increase really , really rapidly .
but what happened when the con@@ ge@@ stion char@@ ges were there is not what you would expect , that people hat@@ ed it more and more .
it &apos;s an un@@ fortunate reality in nearly every major city — road con@@ ge@@ stion , especially during rush hours . jon@@ as eli@@ as@@ son reve@@ als how sub@@ tly nu@@ d@@ ging just a small percentage of dri@@ vers to stay off major roads can make traffic j@@ ams a thing of the past .
these are op@@ i@@ um-@@ addi@@ cted people on the roo@@ fs of kab@@ u@@ l 10 years after the beginning of our war .
so when you hear what i &apos;m going to talk about here today , first of all , i want to say that i am here on be@@ half of all the patients that i have ever met , all the ones i haven &apos;t met .
and when the web came along , that changed everything , because not only could we find information , we could find other people like ourselves who could gather , who could bring us information .
so i went in for an ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und .
well , so what i read on web@@ m@@ d : &quot; the pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis is poor for pro@@ gr@@ essing ren@@ al cell cancer .
because if you wonder why patients are motiv@@ ated and want to help , think about this .
you see , that &apos;s the immune system .
and it goes like this .
so she took it .
when da@@ ve de@@ bron@@ k@@ art learned he had a rare and termin@@ al cancer , he turned to a group of fellow patients online -- and found the medical treatment that saved his life . now he calls on all patients to talk with one another , know their own health data , and make health care better one e-@@ patient at a time . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so i &apos;d like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn &apos;t existed before ; imagine a mining industry that doesn &apos;t mean de@@ fil@@ ing the earth ; imagine bacteria helping us do this by acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating and pre@@ ci@@ pit@@ ating and se@@ di@@ ment@@ ing miner@@ als out of des@@ al@@ ination br@@ ine .
now , what i mean by ech@@ olo@@ cation -- they e@@ mit a sound from their lar@@ yn@@ x out through their mouth or through their nose . this sound wave comes out and it refle@@ cts and e@@ cho@@ es back off objects in their environment , and the bat@@ s then hear these e@@ cho@@ es and they turn this information into an ac@@ ou@@ stic image .
the chinese word for &quot; bat &quot; sounds like the chinese word for &quot; happiness , &quot; and they believe that bat@@ s bring wealth , health , lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty , virtu@@ e and ser@@ en@@ ity .
and one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to diseases , or does this variation just make you different ?
as we age , we de@@ teri@@ or@@ ate , and this de@@ teri@@ or@@ ation causes problems for our society , so we have to address it .
in western society , bat@@ s are often characteri@@ zed as cre@@ ep@@ y , even evil . zo@@ ologist em@@ ma te@@ eling encoura@@ ges us to re@@ think our at@@ titude toward bat@@ s , whose unique and fascinating biology gives us insight into our own genetic ma@@ ke@@ up . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so , what did you do , last time you got serious ?
the commodi@@ ty bo@@ oms are pump@@ ing un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented amounts of money into many , though not all , of the countries of the bottom billion .
so , what goes wrong ? why is there this &quot; resource cur@@ se , &quot; as it &apos;s called ?
and so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong che@@ cks and bal@@ ances .
just in time , a set of economists got there and said , &quot; why not try an au@@ ction ? it &apos;ll reve@@ al the value . &quot;
around the world right now , one billion people are tra@@ pped in poor or fail@@ ing countries . how can we help them ? economist paul colli@@ er la@@ ys out a bold , com@@ passionate plan for clo@@ sing the gap between rich and poor .
surge@@ ons are not made either .
this is all@@ an o@@ kra@@ ine@@ c from tor@@ onto .
this past year i &apos;ve been in latin america , i &apos;ve been in china , talking about the fundament@@ als of la@@ par@@ o@@ scop@@ ic surgery .
more to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place .
steven schwa@@ it@@ z@@ berg : a universal transl@@ ator for surge@@ ons
i liked the fine detail it gave my work , but i wanted to make them larger -- to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
i want to create these o@@ ases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
i &apos;ll leave you with this story .
so whenever i fill up my gas , i think of that liter , and how much carbon .
but now , we have a real technology to do this .
as they do it , in the upper left is a display that &apos;s yo@@ ked to their brain activ@@ ation of their own pain being controlled .
they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings fl@@ our@@ ish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a ma@@ turing science of the mind -- neuroscience , psychology , etc .
the concept of physical health is un@@ defined .
now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral sphere .
but the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gues are right about one thing : we need a universal con@@ ception of human values .
that is what it is to have a do@@ main of expertise .
and so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a v@@ eil , or a very funny hat , or tat@@ too their face -- i think we should be free to volun@@ t@@ arily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constra@@ ints that these women are placed under .
questions of good and evil , right and wrong are common@@ ly thought un@@ answer@@ able by science . but sam harr@@ is argu@@ es that science can -- and should -- be an authority on moral issues , sha@@ ping human values and setting out what constit@@ utes a good life .
you see the mother in between and two daughters , probably on the left and right , and a single egg on the right-@@ hand side .
and after a few days , depending upon temperature , the egg will hat@@ ch and the lar@@ va of this parasi@@ te will eat the ap@@ hi@@ d from the inside .
but again , the question is , here you saw them on a one-@@ to-@@ one basis -- the p@@ est , the natural enemy .
why good bu@@ gs ?
so i think my last slide is : all we are saying , we can actually sing it : give nature a chance .
i was both an automo@@ bile illu@@ str@@ ator and an advertising automo@@ bile copy@@ writer , so i have a lot of reven@@ ge to take on the subject .
the brain@@ less rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody . i do a lot of that .
urban absur@@ dis@@ m -- that &apos;s what the new yorker really calls for .
and then when it ran , a lovely lady , an old lady named mr@@ s. ed@@ gar ro@@ sen@@ berg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover , it was so sweet .
the fourth it@@ em on my check@@ list is relations with ho@@ sti@@ le societies .
how could the e@@ aster is@@ lan@@ ders have de@@ for@@ est@@ ed their environment ?
in particular , what can all of us do ? for those of you who are interested in these choices , there are lots of things you can do . there &apos;s a lot that we don &apos;t understand , and that we need to understand . and there &apos;s a lot that we already do understand , but aren &apos;t doing , and that we need to be doing . thank you .
so insects , just for free , contribute to the economy of the united states with about the same order of mag@@ ni@@ tude , just for free , without everyone knowing .
toma@@ to sou@@ p , pe@@ an@@ ut bu@@ tter , chocolate , no@@ od@@ les -- any process@@ ed food that you &apos;re eating contains insects , because insects are here all around us , and when they &apos;re out there in nature they &apos;re also in our cro@@ ps .
and if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mou@@ ths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent .
you get a new disease that can be dead@@ ly .
so that &apos;s four points for insects .
well that &apos;s just a matter of mind@@ set .
mar@@ c@@ el di@@ cke : it &apos;s all protein .
and being the yo@@ un@@ gest of seven , i have never been at the front of the line for anything . ok ?
&quot; after you . &quot; &quot; oh , no , no . after you . &quot;
and you know , when he walked in , i could just tell that he saw them .
and it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky .
and so , this astro@@ lab@@ e is on lo@@ an from us from the oxford school of -- museum of history .
step three is identify the star on the front of the device .
and it would take a full university course to illu@@ strate it .
knowing the sky , knowing your relationship with the sky , is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is .
we call that the concept of passi@@ ve dynamic lo@@ com@@ o@@ tion .
so , in this video we &apos;re using an approach called the re@@ active approach .
so , this is actually based on that . this robot is called mars : multi-@@ app@@ en@@ da@@ ge robotic system . so , it &apos;s a h@@ ex@@ apo@@ d robot .
we developed these novel actu@@ ators for jo@@ ints .
so , based on that success , the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kin@@ e@@ ma@@ tics .
so , this is for the best human@@ o@@ id , and we would like to bring this for the very first time , to the united states next year , so wish us lu@@ ck .
and then i think , &quot; ah this is cool . &quot;
he gave a talk about how education and school kill@@ s creativity .
so this is ber@@ tie county , north carolina , usa .
the county seat is wind@@ sor .
it &apos;s about designing with people , and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within .
this is in response to the awful mobile tra@@ il@@ ers and the out@@ d@@ ated text@@ books and the terrible materials that we &apos;re building schools out of these days .
so for us , this was a graphic public campaign called connect ber@@ tie .
they &apos;re paid as employees of project h to be the construction cre@@ w with us to build these projects in the community .
and i really , stron@@ g@@ ly believe in the power of the small story , because it is so difficult to do human@@ itarian work at a global scale .
about two thirds , i would guess , of the world is deser@@ ti@@ fying .
so our government formed a team of experts to evalu@@ ate my research .
and watch the change as it goes into this long dry season .
so rather than rein@@ vent the wheel , i began studying other professi@@ ons to see if anybody had .
we now have in the violent hor@@ n of africa pa@@ stor@@ alists planning their gra@@ zing to mi@@ mic nature and open@@ ly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture .
all@@ an sa@@ vor@@ y : how to fight deser@@ ti@@ fication and reverse climate change
so , to imple@@ ment these t@@ win mis@@ sions , a few years ago , i launched project pra@@ k@@ ash .
in fact , the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of depri@@ vation .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s indi@@ cated in the green out@@ lines .
the one thing the visual system needs in order to begin par@@ sing the world is dynamic information .
so , given that kind of video input , with just about six or seven minutes worth of video , dy@@ lan can begin to extract patterns that include faces .
ss : ai@@ mee and i thought we &apos;d just talk a little bit , and i wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distin@@ ctive athle@@ te .
and so i decided to give this a shot : heart po@@ unding , i ran my first race and i beat the national recor@@ d-@@ hol@@ der by three hundre@@ d@@ ths of a second , and became the new national recor@@ d-@@ hol@@ der on my first try out .
you can run with our women &apos;s track team . &quot;
am : no , a year .
i wanted to find out times .
all this training -- i had transformed my life .
you can be eight feet tall . just take them off . &quot;
moder@@ ator : ai@@ mee and the designer of them will be at ted@@ med 2 , and we &apos;ll talk about the design of them .
we &apos;re an hour before the es@@ p@@ ys , and she thought she &apos;d gotten a two-@@ inch he@@ el but she &apos;d actually bought a three-@@ inch he@@ el .
but it &apos;s also a mor@@ ally important one .
now when this law first passed , the world &apos;s hot@@ test mp@@ 3 player could hold just 10 songs .
it &apos;s done by ge@@ ologists , engineers , biologists , all sorts of different people -- mod@@ eling and simulation .
turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form .
that &apos;s an amazing amount of human en@@ dea@@ vor .
bas@@ ics of what ?
and what &apos;s worse , what they &apos;re learning there isn &apos;t even prac@@ tically useful anymore .
it &apos;s called progra@@ mming .
and by the way , she was also very insi@@ stent on being able to change the color , an important feature for this demonstration .
no , what i &apos;m suggest@@ ing is that we should lea@@ p off , we should increase our vel@@ o@@ city so it &apos;s high , and we should lea@@ p off one side and go the other -- of course , having calcul@@ ated our differ@@ ential equation very carefully .
who knows , maybe she was volunte@@ ering for service .
as an architect , that stark ju@@ x@@ ta@@ position of my si@@ gh@@ ted and un@@ si@@ gh@@ ted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful out@@ si@@ ghts of the city itself .
but one time i was in o@@ a@@ kl@@ and walking along broad@@ way , and came to a corner .
in fact , i &apos;ve heard it said in the dis@@ ability community that there are really only two types of people : there are those with dis@@ abilities , and there are those that haven &apos;t quite found thei@@ rs yet .
so , i work for es@@ qui@@ re magazine , and a couple of years ago , i wrote an article called &quot; my ou@@ ts@@ our@@ ced life , &quot; where i hi@@ red a team of people in bang@@ al@@ ore , india , to live my life for me .
so , not very .
the bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mix@@ ed fi@@ bers , so i thought , &quot; sounds strange , but i &apos;ll try it . &quot;
it happened -- i was in the park , and i was d@@ ressed in my bibli@@ cal clo@@ thing , so sand@@ als and sort of a white ro@@ be , you know , because again , the ou@@ ter affec@@ ts the inner .
and my wife thought this was very offen@@ sive , so she sat in every seat in our apartment , and i had to spend much of the year standing until i bought my own seat and carried it around .
so , this idea of sac@@ re@@ dness , whether or not there is a god .
and i would say , &quot; but that &apos;s crazy . &quot;
a.@@ j@@ . jac@@ ob@@ s : my year of living bibli@@ cally
computers and the progra@@ mming languages that we talk to them in , that we teach them in , are hi@@ de@@ ously in@@ sen@@ sa@@ te when it comes to space .
here , the real world mer@@ ges with the simulation .
and , using a hand , we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom , six degrees of navi@@ ga@@ tional control .
and one thing that &apos;s very important is to combine traditional tab@@ ular data with three-dimensional and geo@@ spa@@ tial information .
and again , that stuff needs to be under@@ taken in the context of space .
j@@ u : no , it has to be for every human being .
&amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; min@@ ority report &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; science ad@@ vis@@ er and invent@@ or john under@@ ko@@ ff@@ ler demo@@ s g-@@ speak -- the re@@ al-@@ life version of the film &apos;s eye@@ -@@ po@@ pping , ta@@ i chi@@ -@@ meet@@ s-@@ cyber@@ space computer interface . is this how tomorrow &apos;s computers will be controlled ?
and the interesting moment now , the number of environments where the social design challenge reli@@ es on both of those things being true .
and once they &apos;ve done it , they can do it again , and they could work on getting it better .
if you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late , we &apos;re going to add a 10 she@@ kel fine to your bill .
it &apos;s value created by the partici@@ pants for each other .
it &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal so@@ ap opera to want : it &apos;s got love , joy , happiness , sa@@ dness , te@@ ars , lau@@ ghter , lots of dec@@ eit , intri@@ gue .
as you can see , you can play anywhere .
just as england invented cricket , and made the rest of the world play it .
it was a new thing for us . we had only ever suppor@@ ted our country -- the only two areas in which india was very proud about their country , repres@@ enting itself on the field .
so , just to give you an example of how they did it -- not man@@ che@@ ster united style pro@@ motion , but very mumbai style pro@@ motion . take a look .
and so it started res@@ em@@ bling the indian movies more and more .
h@@ b : suddenly , a game which ear@@ ned its players 50 ru@@ pe@@ es a day -- so 250 ru@@ pe@@ es for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
there &apos;s no fil@@ th , there &apos;s no beg@@ g@@ ars , all the sna@@ ke char@@ mers have van@@ ished , everybody &apos;s gone . this tells you how the capit@@ alist world rules .
now , let me talk about the first one first .
two things are va@@ stly under@@ esti@@ mated : dying by dro@@ w@@ ning and dying by asth@@ ma . why ?
now , a slightly different version of this lot@@ tery : imagine that the nine ti@@ ckets are all owned by one fat guy named ler@@ o@@ y .
because they had the sense that dec@@ lin@@ ing wa@@ ges are worse than rising wa@@ ges , even when the total amount of wa@@ ges is higher in the dec@@ lin@@ ing period . here &apos;s another nice example .
in both cases , it was a piece of paper .
in fact , these it@@ ems that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they &apos;re going to enjoy the po@@ ta@@ to chips .
and at some point you may have met a couple from your own home@@ town , and you thought , &quot; oh , my god , these people are so warm . they &apos;re so nice to me .
maybe that isn &apos;t so remarkable , but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this im@@ pati@@ ence go away by simply changing imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that &apos;s 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months .
watch what happens when we drop some out .
we already know , for example , in the united states , more people have died as a result of not taking air@@ planes -- because they were scared -- and driving on high@@ ways , than were killed in 9 / 11 . ok ?
d@@ g : yes , of course . so , if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be , there might be more and more bus@@ es of 30 people -- we would probably not be nearly so frighten@@ ed .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s quite as specific a mechanism as the one you all@@ u@@ ded to , but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it .
d@@ g : ah , for you in persu@@ ading them .
and this is bat@@ ti@@ sta .
sometimes , in the middle of a resi@@ stant problem , i write down things that i know about it .
i am now ex@@ posing myself to my audience , right ?
the other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one ; you get the big one and if you don &apos;t like that , how about the little one ?
the shadow of ma@@ gri@@ tte falls across the central part of the poster a poe@@ tic event that occur@@ s as the shadow man isol@@ ates the word &apos; hat , &apos; hidden in the word &apos; whatever . &apos; the four hat@@ s shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined : as a thing itself , the worth of the thing , the shadow of the thing , and the shape of the thing .
take the emotion of fear , for instance . it keeps us away from doing things that are really , really ris@@ ky .
je@@ ws , women , homosexu@@ als , un@@ tou@@ ch@@ ables , lo@@ wer@@ -@@ class people -- all of those are imagined as tain@@ ted by the di@@ rt of the body . &quot;
so it not only predi@@ cted self-@@ reported political ori@@ entation , but actual vot@@ ing behavior . and also we were able , with this sample , to look across the world , in 12@@ 1 different countries we asked the same questions , and as you can see , this is 12@@ 1 countries collap@@ sed into 10 different geogra@@ phi@@ cal regions .
the question of whether dis@@ g@@ ust ought to influence our moral and political jud@@ g@@ ments certainly has to be complex , and might depend on exactly what jud@@ g@@ ments we &apos;re talking about , and as a scientist , we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill@@ -@@ equi@@ pped to answer these sorts of questions .
i have this feeling i &apos;d be happy there .
boy : oh , mar@@ cus , you know what i mean .
the first piece was , really , there &apos;s a young woman talking about nigeria , that she has a feeling she &apos;ll be happy there .
child soldiers : ready and willing to die .
various voices : we don &apos;t need no more trouble no more trouble they killed my mother .
we don &apos;t need no more ... commit@@ tee cha@@ ir@@ man : we hope that , with your help and the help of others , that this com@@ mission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the re@@ bel war .
ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diam@@ ond before ?
e@@ o : thank you .
but one of the cool@@ est things in this book are the interactive inf@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cs .
mm : thank you .
and that &apos;s one of the great dile@@ mm@@ as -- we &apos;re in a creativity session -- it &apos;s one of the great dile@@ mm@@ as in creativity : how to do work that &apos;s big enough and not sell out .
back to -- everything &apos;s so temporary .
i just feel un@@ comfortable talking about or building anything on ground zero i think for a long time .
i just stopped .
what &apos;s the sche@@ du@@ le , richard ?
the mit project -- they were intervie@@ wing me for mit and they sent their facili@@ ties people to bil@@ ba@@ o .
bil@@ ba@@ o , i think , shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bas@@ es that are necessary of fit@@ ting into the city .
we sat down , and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet .
in a wil@@ dly enter@@ taining discussion with richard sau@@ l wur@@ man , architect frank ge@@ hr@@ y gives ted@@ sters his take on the power of failure , his recent buildings , and the all-@@ important &quot; then what ? &quot; factor .
and that got me to go out and look at min@@ es like this , and go out and look at the largest industrial in@@ cur@@ sions in the landscape that i could find .
it was only about an h@@ our@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half away from me , and it caught fire about four years ago . it &apos;s around west@@ ley , california , around mo@@ desto .
i came out of a blu@@ e-@@ coll@@ ar town , a g@@ m town , and my father worked at g@@ m , so i was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also in@@ formed my work . but you know , to see china and the scale at which it &apos;s evol@@ ving , is quite something .
this is the town hall for the city .
they &apos;re called den@@ g@@ za@@ ho@@ os -- they &apos;re like p@@ in tac@@ ks to the ground .
and when you start looking at that , and then you start fac@@ tor@@ ing up into a city the size of shanghai , it &apos;s literally a forest of sky@@ scra@@ pers .
it wasn &apos;t too bad , but they &apos;re driven to produce these things at an incredible rate .
they make co@@ ffe@@ e@@ makers here , the biggest co@@ ffe@@ e@@ maker and the biggest iron makers -- they make 20 million of them in the world .
and it isn &apos;t something that isn &apos;t just affec@@ ting our world , but it starts to go up -- because i think we can start correc@@ ting our footprint and bring it down -- but there &apos;s a growing footprint that &apos;s happening in asia , and is growing at a ra@@ pid , ra@@ pid rate , and so i don &apos;t think we can equ@@ alize it . so ultimately the strategy , i think , here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution , because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well .
and this one is : i wish to launch a gro@@ und@@ breaking competition that motiv@@ ates kids to invest ideas on , and invent ideas on , sustainability .
and i think there &apos;s a real possibility to reach new audi@@ ences if i had a chance .
and it &apos;s becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste stre@@ ams .
they have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties .
this is the last fron@@ tier of recycling .
even an occasi@@ onal dead animal , unfortunately .
thank you for your time .
and having thought about this a little bit , i see a couple different possibilities .
the good news about hol@@ ly though is that she doesn &apos;t actually have the same kinds of technologies we do .
it doesn &apos;t look like much -- in fact , it isn &apos;t like much .
you might have them start paying attention to price , paying attention to how much they buy -- sort of keeping track of their monkey to@@ ken , as it were .
so much so that , if you saw the monkeys &apos; numbers , you couldn &apos;t tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market .
i &apos;m just going to give you 500 bucks .
well , it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two bi@@ ases that we have at the psychological level .
all the time , he ad@@ ds one , to give the monkeys two .
the remarkable thing to us is that , when you give monkeys this choice , they do the same ir@@ rational thing that people do .
you know , think of our evolutionary predi@@ le@@ ction for eating sweet things , fat@@ ty things like che@@ es@@ e@@ ca@@ ke .
lau@@ r@@ ie san@@ tos : a monkey economy as ir@@ rational as ours
now , one in three people living in cities today actually live in a sl@@ um .
mass ti@@ mber pan@@ els are those 24@@ -@@ dot bri@@ cks .
and the way i describe it is this .
we were running windows 2000 .
sure , we invest plenty in innovation . we invest in broad@@ band and science education and science gr@@ ants , but we invest far too little in rein@@ venting and re@@ designing the institutions that we have .
created after the post-@@ election ri@@ ots in kenya in 2008 , this cris@@ is@@ -@@ ma@@ pping website and community is actually able to crow@@ d@@ source and target the deli@@ very of better rescu@@ e services to people tra@@ pped under the rub@@ ble , whether it &apos;s after the earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es in haiti , or more recently in it@@ aly .
simply thro@@ wing data over the tran@@ so@@ m doesn &apos;t change how government works .
words like equ@@ ality and fair@@ ness and the traditional elections , democracy , these are not really great terms yet .
so , at the table at 9@@ 15 , i learned something about compassion .
we &apos;re all str@@ ands in it .
i allowed my anger , my bit@@ ter@@ ness , my g@@ rief to sim@@ mer a while , and then i made up my mind that i was going to make a different world , and we can do that together . &quot;
and then the person asked , &quot; well , what do you mean , &apos; neighbor ? &apos; &quot; and he answer@@ ed it by telling the story of the man who fell among th@@ ie@@ ves , and how religious auth@@ orities went the other way , and how their suppor@@ ters in the con@@ gre@@ gation went the other way ; but an uns@@ us@@ pe@@ cting , des@@ pis@@ ed person came along , saw the man in need , provided oil and wine for his wo@@ unds , put him on his own transportation , and took him to the inn and asked the inn@@ kee@@ per , &quot; take care of him . &quot;
and if mama e@@ ternal has taught us correc@@ tly , this song will make sense , not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering , but to all who sign the char@@ ter for compassion .
and it &apos;s syn@@ ony@@ mous with free speech , even if you &apos;re not sure what it is that you have to say .
and around that space , the ring is actually galler@@ ies .
so this is the big idea .
it &apos;s about 1.@@ 2 million cu@@ bic feet of com@@ pres@@ sed air .
this is a point cloud .
i &apos;m doing this because of an old lady in my village now , who have lost her children .
it was somebody sitting somewhere mani@@ pul@@ ating the system , and using religion to get what they want to get out of us , which is the oil , the diam@@ ond , the gold and the land .
never give up . never give in .
my country is war@@ -@@ tor@@ n .
and i almost broke my leg dancing to his music .
and so , the importance of education to me is what i &apos;m willing to die for .
but i &apos;ll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker called em@@ ma mc@@ c@@ une that made it possible for me to be here .
and so , he was dest@@ ined to be raised by a single mom , which might have been all right except that this particular single mom was a par@@ an@@ o@@ id schizophren@@ ic , and when will was five years old she tried to kill him with a bu@@ t@@ cher kni@@ fe .
others of them managed to ex@@ tend the lives of their clients , sometimes by years , sometimes by months .
that &apos;s the first thing i &apos;ve learned .
what we &apos;re talking about today is also rocket science .
they had to rec@@ ru@@ it teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison , they had to establi@@ sh stri@@ ct separ@@ ation between the people who work at the school and the prison auth@@ orities , and most da@@ un@@ t@@ ingly of all , they needed to invent a new curricul@@ um because you know what ?
we &apos;re going to de@@ vote enormous social resources to pun@@ ishing the people who com@@ mit those cri@@ mes , and that &apos;s appropriate , because we should pun@@ ish people who do bad things .
and my dad said , &quot; yeah , but , honey , i think that &apos;s techni@@ cally just between thank@@ s@@ giving and christmas . &quot;
and she said , &quot; listen . the cu@@ t-@@ off date to start kinder@@ garten was september 15 . &quot;
and i sat them down , and i got them glasses of water -- ok , i got it . i got them glasses of water .
and they said , &quot; well , they became our native americans here in the u.s. &quot;
would god force you to get your old nose back ?
and we have not thought enough about the solutions .
he &apos;d be asking us to re@@ design our national accoun@@ ting system to be based upon such important things as social justice , sustainability and people &apos;s well-being .
it thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our bu@@ ck .
maybe some of you have .
another way of looking at it is looking at time trends .
now that &apos;s all very easy to draw graph@@ s and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those cur@@ ves .
keep building them .
and so i think it &apos;s really quite fe@@ asi@@ ble that happiness does not cost the earth .
and this is , i think , the predi@@ cam@@ ent of our lives : that we don &apos;t take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction .
here at ted there are great opportunities .
we &apos;re all un@@ wi@@ tting victims of a collective blind spot .
and we found out that he was h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic , he didn &apos;t speak any english , he had no money , he &apos;d been wander@@ ing the streets for days , star@@ ving , and he &apos;d fa@@ in@@ ted from hunger .
so here i was wal@@ lo@@ wing in a vor@@ tex of emotions and depression and what have you , with the enor@@ mit@@ y of the situation , wanting to go to a place of heal@@ ing , health and happiness .
the metaphor of ma@@ h@@ ish@@ as@@ ur@@ a mar@@ d@@ hin@@ i , of dur@@ ga .
ren@@ owned classi@@ cal indian dan@@ cer an@@ anda sh@@ ank@@ ar ja@@ y@@ ant was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 . she tells her personal story of not only facing the disease but dancing through it , and gives a performance reve@@ aling the metaphor of strength that helped her do it .
it &apos;s difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then .
well , docum@@ ents you read , ok ?
interestingly , data is relationships .
data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms .
tim ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ lee : can you say &quot; data &quot; ?
but , that &apos;s not true .
and we &apos;ve practic@@ ed that .
and combined , this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year , last year , than in the year 2000 .
could they come together and help the millen@@ ni@@ um development goals get re@@ brand@@ ed into the millen@@ ni@@ al generation &apos;s goals ?
now sure , progress in china and india and poverty reduction there was key to that , but recently also in africa , poverty rates are being reduced .
jam@@ ie dru@@ m@@ mond : let &apos;s crow@@ d@@ source the world &apos;s goals
i think you should study in a school of art .
this is the tra@@ ce of fire , this is the tra@@ ce of sun .
or buddha -- if he saw the same cow , he would say , &quot; asking this question den@@ ies your own nature &#91; as a &#93; cow . &quot;
it &apos;s a full-@@ figure cast from myself .
so this is after a few weeks , this is after a few months .
that ev@@ a@@ por@@ ating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture &#91; the &#93; invisible .
this is called &quot; gravity . &quot;
now clearly , david li@@ v@@ ing@@ stone was a little bit ahead of his time , but it does seem useful to ask ourselves , &quot; just how global are we ? &quot;
so clearly , apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic@@ all@@ y-@@ min@@ ded auth@@ ors have over@@ st@@ ated the case .
he &apos;s clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
when you ask people in france what percentage of the french population is im@@ migr@@ ants , the answer is about 24 percent . that &apos;s their guess .
so i developed a whole range around -- mas@@ s-@@ produced range -- that obviously fit@@ ted into a much hig@@ her@@ -@@ end dec@@ or market that could be expor@@ ted and also service our local market .
it &apos;s the same with br@@ ands : the more massive a brand , the more bag@@ ga@@ ge it has , the more force is needed to change its posi@@ tioning .
so next , the scientific method -- an a@@ xi@@ om of physics , of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypo@@ thesis through observation , you can only dis@@ prove it .
it &apos;s out of your control .
it &apos;s also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique .
of course , there are the bas@@ es , which re@@ fer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order , ultimately resul@@ ting in sc@@ oring a run or hit@@ ting a home run , which is usually having vag@@ in@@ al inter@@ course to the point of or@@ gas@@ m , at least for the guy .
that &apos;s just not the way it happens .
and even if you &apos;ve had pizza with somebody for a very long time , don &apos;t you still say things like , &quot; should we get the usual ? &quot;
and we get to decide when we feel satis@@ fied .
i think our ancestors -- i think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their cam@@ p@@ fir@@ es or lay and watched the stars a million years ago .
as one busin@@ ess@@ man in new york said to me , he said , &quot; anything she liked , i liked . &quot;
so we scan@@ ned their brains , looking at a photograph of their s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and looking at a neu@@ tral photograph , with a di@@ stra@@ ction task in between .
it can be focused on nobody .
and it &apos;s going to have an impact .
they &apos;ve got incredible people skills , negoti@@ ating skills .
they &apos;re now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the &quot; symmetri@@ cal marriage , &quot; or the &quot; pure marriage , &quot; or the &quot; compan@@ i@@ on@@ ate marriage . &quot;
but these three brain systems : l@@ ust , romantic love and atta@@ ch@@ ment , aren &apos;t always connected to each other .
not only do they supp@@ ress the dopam@@ ine circuit , but they kill the sex drive .
i &apos;ve been carrying on here about the biology of love .
that wasn &apos;t being asked .
three years later , i found out how wrong i was .
i know it sounds crazy because we &apos;re obviously in the mid@@ st of an obesity epidemic , but hear me out .
so if you can be ob@@ ese and not have insulin resistance , and you can be le@@ an and have it , this suggests that obesity may just be a pro@@ x@@ y for what &apos;s going on .
first , this problem is just simply too important to continue ignor@@ ing because we think we know the answer .
as a young surgeon , peter at@@ ti@@ a felt con@@ temp@@ t for a patient with diabetes . she was over@@ weight , he thought , and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot ampu@@ tation . but years later , at@@ ti@@ a received an un@@ pleas@@ ant medical surprise that led him to wonder : is our understanding of diabetes right ? could the pre@@ cur@@ sor@@ s to diabetes cause obesity , and not the other way around ? a look at how assu@@ mp@@ tions may be leading us to wa@@ ge the wrong medical war .
but my great grandfather , henry ford , really believed that the mission of the ford motor company was to make people &apos;s lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them .
and the good news is today we are tac@@ kl@@ ing the big issues , of cars and the environment -- not only at ford , but really as an industry .
so , if we make no changes today , what does tomorrow look like ?
they &apos;re re@@ lie@@ ving con@@ ge@@ stion , and they &apos;re frankly starting to save some fuel .
but we need people like all of you in this room , leading thin@@ kers .
so , bringing together the small to help facili@@ tate and create the big , i think , is something that we believe in -- something i believe in , and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at ide@@ o .
they said , ok , it &apos;s not about syste@@ mic change .
and finally , for the bri@@ ts , per@@ cy sha@@ w -- this is a big british invention -- saw the cat &apos;s eyes at the side of the road , when he was driving home one night and from that came the cat@@ se@@ ye .
why do we all follow the line in the street ?
sort of having beginn@@ er &apos;s mind , scra@@ ping your mind clean and looking at things af@@ res@@ h .
they &apos;re now called ki@@ ck@@ start .
even in the times of h@@ 1@@ n@@ 1 , i like the word .
and once that happened , they were out in the city convin@@ cing everybody that child labor just had to be abo@@ li@@ shed .
they are playing , all free , for all children .
look at what their parents says .
last i heard , the pre@@ am@@ ble still said , &quot; we , the people of india , &quot; right ?
they were filled with a kind of pione@@ ering passion , fi@@ red about the problems of the ar@@ al sea .
it &apos;s only the beginning of the problem .
how does it affect the design of buildings ?
in other words , we didn &apos;t have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building .
for wind tun@@ nels , we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and bl@@ ast air , and the many kilometers of cable and so on .
you can measure it again .
what if it is the equivalent , depending on where you are , of the grand can@@ al , in terms of tou@@ ri@@ sts , habit@@ ation , des@@ al@@ ination , agriculture ?
and i vo@@ ic@@ ed the thought that maybe at the turn of the year , i thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other , larger countries out there -- the chin@@ as , the indi@@ as , the asi@@ an-@@ pacific ti@@ gers .
they allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way .
it could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a pat@@ ch of the land , high@@ lighting it compared to the di@@ m environment .
it is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other .
so that is a really interesting pro@@ position , i think , and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well-being in mind .
like here -- this is a very low light level actually .
by appreci@@ ating the darkness when you design the light , you create much more interesting environments that truly en@@ h@@ ance our lives .
is it that i artic@@ u@@ late very well ?
or of indian coun@@ c@@ ils of science research do not require that whatever you learn from people , you must share back with them .
we should be doing something about it .
and it all begins with curiosity .
if we can create markets for these artists , we will not have to emplo@@ y them for dig@@ ging earth and breaking st@@ ones .
now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up .
in the sc@@ aling up , there &apos;s an inher@@ ent in@@ ade@@ qu@@ acy to match the needs of the local people , point by point , with the supply that you &apos;re making .
a@@ g : sa@@ i@@ dul@@ lu@@ h sa@@ hi@@ b is in mo@@ ti@@ har@@ i , again in cham@@ par@@ an .
and we have a very vi@@ br@@ ant network in china , particularly , but also emerging in brazil and other parts of the world .
he said , &quot; i can &apos;t . this is the only thing i know , but i &apos;ll invent a machine , which will solve your problem . &quot;
i would love to talk about the technology , and some@@ time , in what &apos;s past the 15 minutes , i &apos;ll be happy to talk to all the tech@@ no-@@ gee@@ ks around here about what &apos;s in here .
150 years ago , lo@@ com@@ o@@ tives got efficient enough , ste@@ am power , that we turned the continent into a country .
or ski@@ ing . it &apos;s just fun , and people love to move around doing fun things .
he agreed . we went to a number of police de@@ part@@ ments that want their police offic@@ ers back in the neighborhood on the beat , carrying 70 pounds of stuff . they love it .
we &apos;ve got to show them this thing .
but , in any event , if you can burn it with the same efficiency -- because it &apos;s ex@@ ternal com@@ bu@@ stion -- as your kitchen sto@@ ve , if you can burn any fuel , it turns out to be pretty ne@@ at .
in dec@@ ember of 2010 , the city of ap@@ at@@ z@@ ing@@ á@@ n in the co@@ ast@@ al state of mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n , in mexico , a@@ wo@@ ke to g@@ un@@ fire .
whether we like it or not , the u.s. is the largest market for illegal sub@@ stances in the world , accoun@@ ting for more than half of global demand .
you see , los zet@@ as is not just this random as@@ sor@@ t@@ ment of individuals , but was actually created by another crimin@@ al organization , the gulf car@@ tel , that used to control the eastern cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of mexico .
finally , the sin@@ alo@@ a feder@@ ation .
the question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stu@@ b@@ born , bli@@ ss@@ ful , volun@@ tary ignor@@ ance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young .
and that &apos;s one way that we try to time technology trends .
you can see around 2001 it finally out@@ -@@ sold the v@@ c@@ r .
this is a fascinating research from who that shows the effect of gener@@ ic drugs on anti-@@ retro@@ viral drug com@@ pounds and cock@@ ta@@ ils .
voice over i@@ p is something you may have heard something about .
india had , still has , a regul@@ ated phone system and so did we .
and their policy prescri@@ ption is to make government more accoun@@ table , focus on the capital markets , invest , don &apos;t give anything away .
in 2002 i met this incredible entrepren@@ eur named am@@ it@@ ab@@ ha sa@@ dan@@ g@@ i from india , who &apos;d been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet .
and while , again , you needed pati@@ ence to move a technology for the poor in india into pakistan , just to get the per@@ mit@@ s , over time we were able to start a company with dr. son@@ o , who runs a large community development organization in the th@@ ar desert , which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country .
and if we take that notion of a global innovation fund , we could use this time to invest not directly in government , though we would have government &apos;s bl@@ essing , nor in international experts , but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country .
we asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons .
jac@@ qu@@ eline no@@ vo@@ gr@@ atz : a third way to think about aid
he makes enough money , just by running ads , to support his family up in or@@ eg@@ on .
and i said to my husband , i said , &quot; ben , can i buy a ban@@ jo ? &quot; and he &apos;s like , &quot; no . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to get cho@@ ked up , because this is my first pet , and she passed away two years ago .
that &apos;s not something that you &apos;re going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels , and people are excited about it .
i would spend hours looking at just the connections , saying , &quot; oh , the little kid up at the top has red hair ; so does that first generation up there . &quot;
and i remember inst@@ antly : i am in germany in this -- i had to go for a one-@@ day trip .
they actually are a fish that is en@@ do@@ ther@@ mic -- powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mam@@ mal .
the result is whether you &apos;re looking at the west or the eastern blu@@ ef@@ in population , there &apos;s been tremendous decline on both sides , as much as 90 percent if you go back with your bas@@ eline to 1950 .
we &apos;re putting them together in unusual ways , and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before .
so in a program called ta@@ g-@@ a-@@ giant we &apos;ve actually gone from ir@@ eland to canada , from cor@@ si@@ ca to spa@@ in .
in this case , we &apos;re actually going to measure the fish .
the center of the atlantic where the mix@@ ing is , i could imagine a policy that lets canada and america fish , because they manage their fisher@@ ies well , they &apos;re doing a good job .
they get returned , and when they get returned , here on a nasa numer@@ ical ocean you can see blu@@ ef@@ in in blue go across their cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , re@@ turning to the western pacific .
and now with google &apos;s oceans , we can actually put a white shark in that ocean .
and usually when i tell people i &apos;m an artist , they just look at me and say , &quot; do you paint ? &quot;
i was like , &quot; no , no . i &apos;m pretty certain there were no explo@@ si@@ ves .
and there was a sin@@ c@@ ere concern there .
see that ? they won &apos;t let me on a plane with that , but they &apos;ll give it to me on the plane .
sometimes there &apos;s a lot of information .
and really , it &apos;s not the most us@@ er-@@ friendly interface .
no one &apos;s really going to bo@@ ther you . &quot;
so it holds onto the very last point .
there is an air@@ b@@ n@@ b host on almost every main street in paris .
and then he happened to stum@@ ble across a post about tas@@ krab@@ bit .
how do we stop people who &apos;ve beha@@ ved bad@@ ly in one community doing so under a different gu@@ ise ?
i was essentially a g@@ host in the system .
let me give you one example from the world of rec@@ ru@@ iting , where reputation data will make the r@@ é@@ sum@@ é seem like an arch@@ a@@ ic reli@@ c of the past .
you all know the truth of what i &apos;m going to say .
we collected data on problems with social gra@@ dients , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social la@@ dder .
it comes from the world values survey .
that relationship is not mainly driven by more crime .
but another really important difference is how they get their greater equ@@ ality .
i think i &apos;m looking and talking about the psycho@@ social effects of ine@@ quality .
what about caus@@ ality ?
despite the advanced technology , it &apos;s not reaching the people who need it most .
so at d-@@ re@@ v , we &apos;ve done some other projects , and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers , to users , to people who need it .
it cli@@ cks .
ours is 7@@ 9 percent , and we &apos;re hoping to get that higher .
and it &apos;s hard for a couple of reasons .
all they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hu@@ st@@ les .
and third of all , it &apos;s so shar@@ p , it just cu@@ ts .
so , ok .
but it really changes the way you think .
there &apos;s something i call the vis@@ cer@@ al level of processing , and there will be vis@@ cer@@ al-@@ level design .
that &apos;s why the global kni@@ ves are so ne@@ at .
and the third level is refle@@ ctive , which is , if you like the super@@ ego , it &apos;s a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do , no control over the -- doesn &apos;t see the senses , doesn &apos;t control the muscles .
so that &apos;s the new me .
that seemed a little dam@@ ning , and i tried to cor@@ relate it with things like infrastructure , or with the avail@@ ability of electricity , and things like that .
if you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this app@@ lies , then you don &apos;t need an alternative education .
and then , as he was doing that , he made an acci@@ dent@@ al click by hit@@ ting the tou@@ ch@@ pad -- you &apos;ll see him do that .
so then i measured , and they were using 200 english words with each other -- mis@@ pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced , but correct us@@ age -- words like ex@@ it , stop , find , save , that kind of thing , not only to do with the computer but in their da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day conversations .
basic windows functions , brow@@ sing , painting , ch@@ at@@ ting and email , games and educational material , music down@@ lo@@ ads , playing video .
they don &apos;t have a way to determine which way to answer this question ; perhaps none of us do .
sug@@ at@@ a mit@@ ra : kids can teach themselves
and he turned to me , and he said , &quot; car@@ ne , you have to be very clever to be a diplomat . &quot;
i mean it was very dramatic diplo@@ macy .
the third reason , i won &apos;t go into .
and i gave it up .
and the koso@@ v@@ ars were not allowed a diplo@@ matic service .
and watching ? what if !
i can connect any one of you by six degrees of separ@@ ation to the al-@@ s@@ hab@@ a@@ ab mili@@ ti@@ a in som@@ alia .
and of course , nothing happened -- nobody did anything .
and it ser@@ ves you the 40@@ 4 page .
jo@@ ey !
here in america , people actually love tv .
why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
right at the end of the 60s , moral ambi@@ gu@@ ity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wan@@ e .
it means in the 196@@ 6 television season , the &quot; smo@@ thers brothers &quot; came out of nowhere .
incredible ma@@ pping of our national psy@@ che with some hard and fast facts : un@@ emplo@@ yment .
we &apos;re animals , we need our mom@@ s .
these sym@@ pa@@ thetic s@@ miles spread all throughout the room now , and i realize that all of my other students are in the same boat , that maybe they took notes or they memor@@ ized defini@@ tions from the text@@ book , but not one of them really understood the main ideas .
the workers still come the next day , they do their job , but they &apos;re following different instruc@@ tions .
right ? i mean , because god for@@ bi@@ d somebody have fun when they &apos;re learning science .
and that guy &apos;s like , &quot; actually , it was 8@@ 7@@ .@@ 3 miles . &quot;
make me laugh . make me care .
in 190@@ 2 , the great american psych@@ ologist william james wrote about the many var@@ ie@@ ties of religious experience .
and that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self-@@ tran@@ scen@@ dent experiences .
and once people circle around some sacred object or value , they &apos;ll then work as a team and fight to def@@ end it .
in other words , charles darwin believed in group selection .
there &apos;s a mutation in the gene and one of them mu@@ tat@@ es to follow a sel@@ fish strategy .
and the most co@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ ve hi@@ ves won , just as darwin said .
i mean that we evolved to see sac@@ re@@ dness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects , people and ideas .
and this explains the extraordinary reson@@ ance of this simple metaphor con@@ ju@@ red up nearly 400 years ago .
on the outside it looks like a very typical garage , a nice garage .
and so there is a good reason for this .
this , as many of you have probably gu@@ essed , is a recently emp@@ tied beer can in portu@@ gal .
this is for a book by &quot; me@@ tro@@ poli@@ s . &quot;
if you &apos;ve had any design cour@@ ses , they would teach you you can &apos;t read this .
and i only show it because it seemed like it got all this relev@@ an@@ cy all of a sudden , and it was done right after 9 / 11 .

i just have a feeling this kid &apos;s been there for a week , you know .
yeah , he jum@@ ps out of buildings . it &apos;s -- unfortunately , this one works , kind of , as a spread .
you have to utili@@ ze who you are in your work .
david car@@ son : design and discovery
and i &apos;m , this morning , going to talk about this for the first time .
those are the general approach@@ es to life . that &apos;s one way to look at life on earth today .
and again , my question is , what does technology want ?
but the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom , those indi@@ cate basically a par@@ ent@@ age of a type of cor@@ net that was no longer made . that does not happen in biology .
we &apos;ve heard about this and that . but i actually went back and took what i could find , the examples in history where there have been pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions against technology , and then i tried to find out when they came back in , because they always came back in . and it turns out that the time , the du@@ ration of when they were out@@ la@@ wed and pro@@ hi@@ b@@ ited , is decre@@ asing over time . and that basically , you can del@@ ay technology , but you can &apos;t kill it . so this makes sense , because in a certain sense what culture is , is the accu@@ mu@@ lation of ideas .
differences , freedom , choices , possibilities .
and so i think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are .
now , the fish in the tan@@ ks were gor@@ geous to look at , but they didn &apos;t really interact with people .
if you &apos;re a wild@@ life film@@ maker and you &apos;re going out into the field to film animals , especially behavior , it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are , how they work and , you know , a bit about their behaviors .
if you &apos;re going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals , you might as well pick one that &apos;s fairly common .
and this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees f@@ .
and you go back , and i &apos;m at home , and i &apos;m thinking , &quot; okay , what can i shoot ...
i &apos;ve been to a lot of lec@@ tures where , at the end of it , inevi@@ t@@ ably , one of the first questions that comes up is , &quot; but , but what can i do ?
and it &apos;s my hope that some of these &quot; hope spots &quot; can be in the deep ocean , an area that has histor@@ ically been seriously ne@@ gle@@ cted , if not ab@@ used .
we pass it down from generation to generation .
now my perspective is a particularly -- -- my perspective is a particularly american perspective .
it &apos;s now more than 8@@ 2 percent .
and if you have a serious theory , you should be able to predict when google is going to go b@@ ust .
what is pl@@ ot@@ ted here is metaboli@@ c rate -- how much energy you need per day to stay alive -- versus your weight , your mass , for all of us bunch of organisms .
don &apos;t know . we will discuss that .
just to show you what we pl@@ ot@@ ted , here is income , gdp -- gdp of the city -- crime and pat@@ ents all on one graph .
and in fact , if you compare it to data , it fits very well with the development of cities and economies .
that red line is from the theory .

this is the complete anti@@ thesis of regener@@ ative medicine .

we heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .
this is a horse . the horse is not in pain .
and what i &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient .

thank you so very much for having me here today .
you know , she &apos;s only half jewish .
well , i don &apos;t know how else to say it to you , so i &apos;ll just say it my way : the gan@@ ey@@ vis@@ h sch@@ ti@@ ck@@ lich coming from the governments and the , you know , the bank@@ ers and the wall street . you know it .
and i &apos;m just trying not to pan@@ ic and fre@@ ak out . so i like , take a deep breath .
that &apos;s very good . i love that .
but , you know , i am origin@@ ally from india , and i wanted to start by telling you that once sarah jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to ted in california , origin@@ ally , i was very pleas@@ ed and , frankly , re@@ lie@@ ved because , you know , i am a human rights advo@@ cate .
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s bad , but i told him , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with a chinese woman ? &quot;
thank you . x@@ ie x@@ ie .
thank you all very much . it was lovely .
and what really drives me is a vision of the future that i think we all share .
so i figured i needed to learn a little bit more about business , so i went to stanford business school and studied there .
and she started it about 10 years ago , and today , she educ@@ ates over a quarter million african girls .
in 2005 , we launched our first s@@ late of films , &quot; mur@@ der ball , &quot; &quot; north country , &quot; &quot; sy@@ ri@@ ana &quot; and &quot; good night and good lu@@ ck . &quot;
it was also a pretty good year for this guy .
it &apos;s been a real honor . thank you .
and like i tell my family , and my wife re@@ minds me every time , &quot; you &apos;re ris@@ king your life , you know , every time you go to that country . &quot;
now , if something like this , which has happened in the u.k. , that &apos;s where they go . this is the intensive care unit in which i work .
so what we going to do now ?
no ? yes ? doesn &apos;t matter , it worked .
apart from the a@@ wards it &apos;s won , it &apos;s port@@ able and it &apos;s cer@@ ti@@ fied . it &apos;s regi@@ stered , the m@@ hr@@ a -- and the ce mark , for those who don &apos;t know , for europe , is the equivalent of the f@@ da in the u.s.
i have to serve . &quot;
in jo@@ han@@ nes@@ burg , i had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , midd@@ le-@@ class south african audience who ended up in te@@ ars because i use film cli@@ ps that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are ten@@ ding to avoid , because they are fa@@ ti@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
at this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-@@ blo@@ wn aids and had p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia .
on january 24@@ th , apple computer will introduce ma@@ cin@@ to@@ sh .
and many of the ag@@ ents sh@@ red@@ ded as many of the docum@@ ents as they could and left them behind in pil@@ es .
and that &apos;s done in part with the help from western technology .
after all , companies didn &apos;t stop pollu@@ ting gro@@ und@@ water as a matter of course , or emplo@@ ying 10-@@ year-olds as a matter of course , just because execu@@ tives wo@@ ke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do .
so what trig@@ ger@@ ed this extraordinary growth in cross-@@ border crime ?
well , he would turn to people who were called , rather pro@@ sa@@ ically by soci@@ ologists , pri@@ va@@ ti@@ zed law en@@ for@@ cement agen@@ cies .
six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months as a direct consequence of the coca@@ ine trade .
and remember , 20 of these speed bo@@ ats were coming across the ad@@ ri@@ a@@ tic every single night .
since the beginning of globalization , the global nar@@ co@@ tics market has exp@@ anded enor@@ m@@ ously .
and it &apos;s actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cyber@@ crime is that it &apos;s not so much the technology .
it is a major economic force and we need to take it very , very seriously .
the ance@@ stor of the ap@@ es stayed in the trees ; our ancestors went out onto the pla@@ in .
and now it &apos;s whi@@ pped away from under you .
you must never do that again . &quot;
but you can say this : all the ap@@ es and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs , if they want to , for a short time .
and the ir@@ onic thing about it is that they are not sta@@ ving off the a@@ qua@@ tic theory to protect a theory of their own , which they &apos;ve all agreed on , and they love .
the water is lovely .
and it &apos;s not easy to change their minds .
&quot; de@@ ar sir , good day , compli@@ ments of the day , and my best wi@@ sh@@ es to you and family . i know this letter will come to you surprisingly , but let it not be a surprise to you , for nature has a way of arri@@ ving un@@ announced , and , as an ada@@ ge says , origin@@ als are very hard to find , but their e@@ cho@@ es sound lou@@ der . so i decided to contact you myself , for you to as@@ sure me of safety and honest@@ y , if i have to ent@@ r@@ ust any amount of money under your cu@@ sto@@ dy .
and that &apos;s nothing to be ash@@ amed of .
i &apos;m obsessed with email . i get a lot of it .
it &apos;s true . some people say to me , they say , &quot; ze , you &apos;re doing all this stuff , this internet stuff , and you &apos;re not making any money .
we &apos;re in a culture of gur@@ u-@@ ship . it &apos;s so hard to use some software because , you know , it &apos;s un@@ approach@@ able , people feel like they have to read the man@@ ual .
but it &apos;s peri@@ pher@@ al activities , like these , that allow people to get together , doing fun things .
how about you get on the phone ?
par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph number two : you may actually have to just get very bl@@ unt and say what &apos;s really on your mind .
o@@ mar ah@@ mad : political change with pen and paper
so i make other hat@@ s as well .
so i made a we@@ ar@@ able wall that i could wear as a back@@ pack .
and so this is constructed out of a heat refle@@ cted material that ser@@ ves to medi@@ ate the difference in temperature between the human body and the gl@@ ac@@ ial ice .
all right , so i go back from ted , and then the following week , i &apos;m invited to a dinner party in washington , d.c. , where i know that i &apos;ll be meeting a number of conserva@@ tive intellec@@ tu@@ als , including yu@@ val le@@ vin , and to prepare for the meeting , i read this article by le@@ vin in national aff@@ air@@ s called &quot; beyond the wel@@ fare state . &quot;
to understand why this is happening to us , and what we can do about it , we need to learn more about moral psychology .
now that process feels great . it feels really satis@@ fying .
you know , rat@@ ings in the 70s on a 10@@ 0-@@ point scale .
you step out of line , you get pun@@ ished .
rising ine@@ quality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy .
and then there &apos;s everybody else : the children who don &apos;t benefit from a stable marriage , who don &apos;t have as much invest@@ ed in them , who don &apos;t grow up in a stable environment , and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph .
now this is a social disaster , and liber@@ als are very concerned about this .
so , i &apos;m interested in the use of metaboli@@ c materials for the practice of architecture .
so , bot@@ tom@@ -up materials actually exist today .
what we need it to do is to be crea@@ tively cra@@ fted around the woo@@ den pil@@ es .
i &apos;ve spent hundreds of days in psychi@@ atri@@ c hospitals .
that is , at best , i was expected to live in a board and care , and work at men@@ ial jobs .
several years ago , i decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey , and i want to share some more of that story with you today to con@@ vey the inside view .
continu@@ ing with the wri@@ t@@ ings : &quot; the next morning i went to my professor &apos;s office to ask for an exten@@ sion on the mem@@ o assign@@ ment , and i began gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ing un@@ intelli@@ g@@ ably as i had the night before , and he eventually brought me to the emergency room .
we don &apos;t like to be stra@@ pped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would .
hundreds of thousands with thoughts , inter@@ di@@ ction . &apos; &apos; el@@ yn , do you feel like you &apos;re dangerous to yourself or others ?
the better we understand these ill@@ n@@ esses , the better the treatments we can provide , and the better the treatments we can provide , the more we can offer people care , and not have to use force .
and then i decided i &apos;d dedi@@ cate my life to saving one million people every year .
do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people ?
this is pri@@ ck@@ ly pe@@ ar cre@@ ek .
most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation &apos;s free , and some of you &apos;ll be happy to know that it involves beer .
we pay them to leave their water in-@@ stream .
last september of 2011 , i started an online magazine for teen@@ age girls called ro@@ ok@@ ie@@ mag@@ .@@ com@@ .
i got about 3,000 e@@ mails .
perhaps something very n@@ au@@ gh@@ ty .
it &apos;s sort of a funny pattern .
what does that mean ?
so , having said all that , what is the secret formul@@ a for bre@@ wing compassion in the corporate setting ?
the idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is cal@@ m and clear at the same time .
in 1994 , i walked into a prison in cam@@ bo@@ dia , and i met a 12@@ -year-old boy who had been tor@@ tured and was den@@ ied access to coun@@ sel .
but one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vege@@ table s@@ eller , she was sitting outside of a house .
i was recently in egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . the police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . they were tor@@ turing everybody all the time . &quot;
and on dec@@ ember 4 , he organized three thousand members of the you@@ th commun@@ ist lea@@ gue , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed po@@ sters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-@@ violent legal revolution to protect citi@@ zen rights .
thank you .
so , everybody &apos;s always suggest@@ ing new hum@@ ble master@@ pieces , and at mom@@ a we put out some books just for people to suggest their own hum@@ ble master@@ pieces .
they tried to make a to@@ dd@@ ler &apos;s gas mas@@ k in such a way that the to@@ dd@@ ler can be held by the parent because pro@@ x@@ im@@ ity of the body is so important .
instead , she said , &quot; no , no . work and lei@@ sure can be together . &quot;
but the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shel@@ ter is your sense of self , and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic .
many of you might know that the po@@ ta@@ to chip chair by charles and ray e@@ ames comes exactly from that kind of instance : fi@@ ber@@ glass was available for civili@@ an use all of a sudden .
we &apos;re not the only ones .
and i remember thinking , i mean , why don &apos;t these guys just take me to a cheap school ?
and i &apos;m pretty much the one who figured it out , because i was a ner@@ d .
this is the damage it causes .
and going back to the point i was trying to make , this is the swa@@ hil@@ i wikipedia .
with two pay@@ che@@ cks , or three pay@@ che@@ cks , i could solve a lot of my family &apos;s problems .
another thing is that these leaders are a refle@@ ction of our society .
and because of the opportunities that were aff@@ or@@ ded to me , i am able to lift all those people .
we just need a push .
i nearly died , was in a com@@ a , stayed at the hospital for two years , and under@@ went 36 sur@@ ger@@ ies to be able to walk again .
over 6@@ 0,000 people came to the start line , all wearing white t-@@ shir@@ ts with no political slo@@ gan@@ s .
we are now one of the largest running events in the middle east , but most importantly , it is a platform for hope and cooperation in an ever@@ -@@ fragi@@ le and un@@ stable part of the world .
he told me that there had been two deaths ; the mother and child both had died .
now we knew we had to design something which she could use .
and by the time i &apos;m done , in 20@@ 20 , when the who publi@@ sh@@ es the data again , this is going to be the map of an@@ emi@@ a .
now , when i got this , i was -- press cap@@ s lock -- absolutely fre@@ ak@@ ed out , okay ?
and , on the left , ri@@ ley .
no cities like you see today in do@@ ha or du@@ bai or ab@@ u d@@ hab@@ i or ku@@ wait or ri@@ y@@ ad@@ h .
it &apos;s 1.@@ 7 million people .
so that is our lake , if you can see it .
is there a sustainable solution ?
i &apos;ll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can and is actually changing the world , and whose name is people power .
and everybody was ama@@ zed when the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator opened and millions of young , mainly se@@ cular people step out to do the change . guess what ? they didn &apos;t watch the demo@@ graphics .
so unity is a big thing , and this can be achieved .
this is dynamics between fear and a@@ pathy on one side and enthusi@@ as@@ m and humor on another side .
we are watching the great example of something else the internet can do .
i wo@@ ke up the morning after i gave that talk with the worst vulnerability han@@ go@@ ver of my life .
and i said , &quot; remember when we &apos;d leave a really bad message on our ex@@ -@@ boy@@ friend &apos;s answer@@ ing machine ?
vulnerability is not we@@ ak@@ ness .
i am not a natural vulnerability researcher .
here &apos;s why .
you know why this place is amazing ?
the thing to understand about shame is it &apos;s not guil@@ t .
i can bring home the bac@@ on , fr@@ y it up in the pan and never let you forget you &apos;re a man . &quot;
and to get out from underneath it , to find our way back to each other , we have to understand how it affec@@ ts us and how it affec@@ ts the way we &apos;re par@@ enting , the way we &apos;re working , the way we &apos;re looking at each other .
they fly , not with ro@@ tat@@ ing components , so they fly only by fla@@ pping their wings .
with a split wing we get the lift at the upper wing , and we get the pro@@ pul@@ sion at the lower wing .
if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses , then almost one in five indi@@ ans will require eye care , a stag@@ gering 200 million people .
larry brilliant : he kept talking about mcdon@@ al@@ ds and ham@@ bur@@ gers , and none of it made any sense to us .
so i think we have a process by which we can really pen@@ et@@ rate into the market and reach everyone who needs it , and in this process of using technology , make sure that most don &apos;t need to come to the base hospital .
but this really requires going beyond what we do , or what we have done , if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blin@@ dness .
and i &apos;m sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these .
so you move around the content on a display , but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device .
think of a ham@@ ster in the pocket .
they seemed to see me in terms of their assu@@ mp@@ tions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair .
in fact , i now call the underwater wheelchair &quot; port@@ al , &quot; because it &apos;s literally pus@@ hed me through into a new way of being , into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness .
and b@@ p was hardly our first experience of this in recent years .
another explanation that you often hear for re@@ ck@@ less@@ ness is hu@@ br@@ is .
but this is not the only fair@@ y@@ tale we tell ourselves about nature .
there will always be another fron@@ tier .
it &apos;s not even mining .
you see , for some people , their sa@@ vi@@ or is a guy in a flo@@ wing ro@@ be .
ted is about invention , let &apos;s be honest . right ? dh : yeah , it is .
oh , good . all right .
having a little bit of richard time . that &apos;s nice , that &apos;s good .
bf : that &apos;s cool . i always wanted to try that .
bf : no , it &apos;s a has@@ s@@ le . traveling too much .
dh : may we have our jum@@ ping music please ?
and believe it or not , you don &apos;t win ju@@ g@@ gling cham@@ pi@@ ons for doing things with bu@@ ll@@ whi@@ ps or sha@@ ker cu@@ ps .
dh : wow ! what a great trick , bar@@ ry !
dh : ... to back .
the thing he designed was this mon@@ stro@@ sity here , the analy@@ tical engine . now , just to give you an idea of this , this is a view from above .
and there &apos;s not just one of these , there &apos;s many of them .
this is a program written in a particular style .
it did have a ra@@ m pack .
i have to kill a fren@@ ch@@ man when i come back at home ?
like al gore told you , two billion people live on the water from the gl@@ aci@@ er of hi@@ mal@@ a@@ ya .
we have done five thousand interviews .
at the moment , my family is very poor , my life here in sh@@ enz@@ hen is just about showing myself that i can ear@@ n more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on .
i &apos;m very proud to show you the te@@ as@@ er .
we haven &apos;t yet understood that we &apos;re going at a much faster pace than the planet can susta@@ in .
women have two cop@@ ies of that big x chromo@@ some ; men have the x and , of course , that small copy of the y@@ .
so the worldwide capacity to sequence human genom@@ es is something like 50,000 to 100,000 human genom@@ es this year .
their mom is a very bra@@ ve woman who didn &apos;t believe that the symptoms weren &apos;t mat@@ ching up , and through some hero@@ ic efforts and a lot of internet searching , she was able to convince the medical community that , in fact , they had something else .
the pro@@ spe@@ ct of using the genome as a universal diagno@@ stic is upon us today .
do you want to see whether you &apos;re gene@@ tically com@@ pati@@ ble with your gir@@ l@@ friend ? sure .
you have bigger cl@@ an gather@@ ings and so on .
so i &apos;m thinking , you know , this proce@@ d@@ ure hasn &apos;t changed in about 40 years .
adult stem cells are throughout our body , including the bloo@@ d-@@ forming stem cells in our bone mar@@ row , which we &apos;ve been using as a form of ste@@ m-@@ cell therapy for over 40 years .
for a coral , bran@@ ching into different cop@@ ies is the most natural thing in the world .
this energy is immediately conver@@ ted into a spra@@ y of sub@@ atom@@ ic particles , with dete@@ ctors and computers used to figure out their properties .
a particle that hasn &apos;t been seen yet , but we &apos;re pretty sure exists , is the higgs particle , which gives mas@@ ses to all these other particles .
whenever particles interact , nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions .
we want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe .
the pattern of this shape living in ei@@ ght-@@ dimensional charge space is ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely beautiful , and it sum@@ mari@@ zes thousands of possible interactions between these element@@ ary particles , each of which is just a fac@@ et of this complicated shape .
well , pretty bad .
but i also great@@ ly enjoy the company of hyper@@ -@@ intelligent people .
but thank you so much for coming . that was absolutely fascinating .
mr. wurz@@ el . the female has her first baby when she &apos;s 11 or 12 .
&quot; how can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees , when the people living around the national park are strug@@ gling to survive ? &quot;
today , we are developing what we call the greater g@@ om@@ be ecosystem .
we have the re@@ ck@@ less burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gas@@ ses , so called , leading to climate change .
we have a choice . every one of us in this room , we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make .
hope . that &apos;s the question i get asked as i &apos;m going around the world : &quot; jane , you &apos;ve seen so many terrible things , you &apos;ve seen your chimpanzees decre@@ ase in number from about one million , at the turn of the century , to no more than 15@@ 0,000 now , and the same with so many other animals .
this change , this change . to see change that we must have if we care about the future .
i &apos;m a visual artist , and i &apos;m also one of the co-@@ fo@@ under@@ s of the plastic pollution co@@ ali@@ tion .
so i came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue , and we created the plastic pollution co@@ ali@@ tion .
artist di@@ an@@ na co@@ hen shares some tough tru@@ ths about plastic pollution in the ocean and in our lives -- and some thoughts on how to free ourselves from the plastic gy@@ re .
so one important difference is that it &apos;s totally mobile .
but it &apos;s not perfect yet , it &apos;s very much a work in progress .

with 20 billion dollars , everyone can have access to safe drinking water .
we have seen lat@@ er@@ al shif@@ ts of power -- the power of gre@@ e@@ ce passed to ro@@ me and the power shif@@ ts that occurred during the european civili@@ zations -- but we are seeing something slightly different .
it will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treat@@ y-@@ based systems , treat@@ y-@@ based agre@@ ements , to gover@@ n that global space .
it &apos;s going to be quite gr@@ um@@ py as china begins to democra@@ ti@@ ze her society after liber@@ alizing her economy .
now we have to create the g@@ 20 .
le@@ h@@ man brothers goes down , the whole lot collap@@ ses .
it used to be the case that if my tri@@ be was more powerful than their tri@@ be , i was safe ; if my country was more powerful than their country , i was safe ; my alli@@ ance , like na@@ to , was more powerful than their alli@@ ance , i was safe .
they &apos;ve probably heard of the south beach diet , or the at@@ kins diet .
biologists term pro@@ creative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation , the age when your children have children .
and research shows that they would be years largely free of chr@@ onic disease , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
and in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
but , like sar@@ din@@ ia , o@@ kin@@ a@@ wa has a few social constru@@ cts that we can associ@@ ate with lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
and i asked her what it felt like to hold a great@@ -@@ great@@ -@@ great@@ -@@ grand@@ daughter .
for 24 hours every week , no matter how busy they are , how st@@ ressed out they are at work , where the kids need to be driven , they stop everything and they focus on their god , their social network , and then , hard@@ wired right in the religion , are nature walks .
i &apos;m probably the only person you &apos;ll ever meet who ro@@ de his bicycle across the sahara desert without s@@ uns@@ cre@@ en .
they have vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary for sense of purpose , i@@ k@@ ig@@ ai , like the o@@ kin@@ aw@@ ans .
he did it because he couldn &apos;t afford a car , but also because he knew how to build one .
so for now , they exist mostly in this realm of trade secre@@ ts and pat@@ ents only universi@@ ties and corpo@@ rations have access to .
&#91; &quot; paper speakers &quot; &#93; what we &apos;re seeing here is just a piece of paper with some cop@@ per tape on it connected to an mp@@ 3 player and a mag@@ net .
but no , this guy isn &apos;t slo@@ wing down .
in the future , with cars ex@@ changing data with each other , we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind , to the right and left , all at the same time , bird &apos;s eye view , we will actually be able to see into those cars .
what happens if two cars share that data , if they talk to each other ?
and i think it &apos;s going to be a great thing .
we had one government agency and one company aircraft oper@@ ator say , you &apos;re crazy , don &apos;t do that , you &apos;re going kill the guy .
and a third .
we don &apos;t want to do that to our students .
no life , from the small@@ est life to everybody here , would be possible without these little micro-@@ machines .
three : i failed to realize that hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness is an at@@ titude , not a lifestyle .
but i felt out of control of my life .
and i cri@@ ed .
now , when i was a young man -- 40 years ago , the country was very , very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty .
so they could supply p@@ ills and con@@ dom@@ s throughout the country , in every village of the country .
we had rela@@ y ra@@ ces with con@@ dom@@ s , we had children &apos;s con@@ dom@@ -@@ blo@@ wing cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t worry . come over and i &apos;ll do the whole lot of you . &quot;
and here , every media person had to be trained for hiv .
and these were the con@@ dom@@ s that we introduced .
we all need to help .
and then this is our answer to star@@ bucks in tha@@ iland -- &quot; coffee and con@@ dom@@ s . &quot;
so a couple .
if i get in front of ro@@ mo here .
this is actually something that one of our engineers , dom , built in a wee@@ k@@ end .
all stories interest me , and some ha@@ unt me until i end up writing them .
the streets of tur@@ in were covered with red po@@ sters announ@@ cing the slo@@ gan of the olymp@@ ics .

call it a@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ te , or ven@@ us , or b@@ im@@ bo , or whatever you want ; the name doesn &apos;t matter , as long as we understand what it is about , and we support it .
they are the poorest of the poor .

it is a very useful concept , but behavi@@ or@@ ally , it may not exactly explain what people do the first time they play these types of economic games or in situations in the outside world .
what happens with these one@@ - and two-@@ step types ?
so they have a chance of -- they bi@@ cker and dis@@ agree and end up with less money .
we share more genes with them than ze@@ br@@ as do with hor@@ ses .
the chim@@ ps are actually interacting with each other through the computers .
it &apos;s one of the great questions of our time .
a billion of us are ob@@ ese , while a further billion star@@ ve .
and the food obviously went off very quickly .
but also you have to imagine it full of food .
now it &apos;s anony@@ mous .
because it &apos;s an ideal . it &apos;s an imagin@@ ary thing . we can &apos;t have it .
it &apos;s a greenhouse , where kids get told all about food and growing their own food .
every day , in a city the size of london , 30 million me@@ als are ser@@ ved . but where does all the food come from ? architect car@@ oly@@ n steel discus@@ ses the daily miracle of feeding a city , and shows how ancient food rou@@ tes shaped the modern world .
and so we have a choice , it seems to me .
and also see that it dem@@ ands ac@@ ute intelligence , not just a goo@@ ey feeling .
i believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-@@ assem@@ bling , repli@@ cating and re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing themselves .
and i think it really brings to light : is this really sc@@ al@@ able ?
it &apos;s directly embedded ; there &apos;s no ex@@ ternal instruc@@ tions .
and i was there to honor a great 20th century explor@@ er , ro@@ y chap@@ man andre@@ ws .
so basically we had automobil@@ es , but we were un@@ aware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet .
a little over a hundred years ago , people were un@@ aware of viruses , the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet .
all you &apos;ve got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back , and you won &apos;t see any walls or chemical sc@@ um at all -- all you see is a blue planet . and if you go further than that , you &apos;ll see the sun , the solar system , and the stars and so on .
they &apos;re called &quot; quas@@ ars . &quot; quas@@ ars origin@@ ally meant qu@@ asi@@ -@@ stell@@ ar object .
our location is satur@@ ated with evidence , and also with matter and energy .
i think he &apos;s going to talk about that later in the conference .
and with problems that we are not aware of yet , the ability to put right -- not the she@@ er good lu@@ ck of avo@@ i@@ ding in@@ definitely -- is our only hope , not just of solving problems , but of survival .
that &apos;s the kind of rules that the cell@@ phone company that nelson pur@@ ch@@ ases his tele@@ ph@@ ony from oper@@ ates under .
what haiti war@@ ns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak .
one of the z@@ ones next to hong kong has a city called sh@@ enz@@ hen .
people can come live under the new char@@ ter , but no one is forced to live under it .
now , where else might this model be tried ?
what university profess@@ ors could do is write some details that might go into this man@@ ual .
how can a strug@@ gling country break out of poverty if it &apos;s tra@@ pped in a system of bad rules ? economist paul ro@@ mer un@@ vei@@ ls a bold idea : &quot; char@@ ter cities , &quot; cit@@ y-@@ scale admini@@ stra@@ tive z@@ ones gover@@ ned by a co@@ ali@@ tion of nations .
it turns out , almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same phot@@ ore@@ cep@@ tors , and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication .
our first thought about synthetic genom@@ ics came when we sequen@@ ced the second genome back in 199@@ 5 , and that from my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gen@@ itali@@ um .
basically , any virus that &apos;s been sequen@@ ced today -- that genome can be made .
so we know lots of different path@@ ways , thousands of different organisms now that live off of co2 , and can capture that back .
it &apos;s about time . end sequence . take one .
they were self-@@ confi@@ dent and determined . and the key for me today , the key for you , is , they were fu@@ tu@@ re-@@ focused rather than pres@@ ent-@@ focused .
developing the mental flexi@@ bility to shift time perspe@@ c@@ tives flu@@ i@@ dly depending on the dem@@ ands of the situation , that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to learn to do .
we are dro@@ w@@ ning in news .
britain will star@@ ve without gene@@ tically modi@@ fied cro@@ ps .
and it pa@@ ins me that i can &apos;t tell you all that we have learned with cas@@ sin@@ i .
it &apos;s cold , it &apos;s e@@ erie , it &apos;s mi@@ sty , it might be ra@@ ining , and you might be standing on the shor@@ es of lake mich@@ ig@@ an bri@@ mming with paint thin@@ ner .
so it was -- i mean , i &apos;m getting goo@@ se bu@@ mp@@ s just talking about it .
but still , there was no sign in our images , or even in the hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; images , of any large , open bodies of flu@@ ids .
in other words , we have possibly stum@@ bled upon the hol@@ y gra@@ il of modern day planet@@ ary exploration , or in other words , an environment that is potentially su@@ itable for living organisms .
so i &apos;m here today to talk about the power of attention , the power of your attention , and the emergen@@ ce and development of non@@ violent movements in the west bank , ga@@ za and elsewhere -- but today , my case study is going to be palest@@ ine .
it &apos;s like fall@@ u@@ ja@@ h . shooting everywhere .
in the course of taking my film to villages in the west bank , in ga@@ za and in east jerusalem , i have seen the impact that even one docum@@ entary film can have in influ@@ encing the transformation .
millions of people were in severe need of help .
as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was ma@@ pped . this slo@@ ws the deli@@ very of aid after a disaster -- and hi@@ des the economic potential of un@@ used lands and unknown roads . in this short talk , google &apos;s l@@ al@@ it@@ es@@ h kat@@ ra@@ g@@ ad@@ da demo@@ s map maker , a group ma@@ p-@@ making tool that people around the globe are using to map their world .
so how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment ?
but now as the rat explor@@ es around , each individual cell fir@@ es in a whole ar@@ ray of different lo@@ cations which are laid out across the environment in an ama@@ z@@ ingly regular tri@@ ang@@ ular grid .
they could define the vie@@ wing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual ima@@ gery , so you can imagine what happened when you were at this we@@ dding , for example .
all i did was co@@ di@@ fy it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s simpl@@ est idea .
that &apos;s how most marketing is done , that &apos;s how most sales is done and that &apos;s how most of us communicate inter@@ personally .
nobody bought one .
and the best we can muster up is , &quot; i don &apos;t know . it just doesn &apos;t feel right . &quot;
they had no money ; they paid for their dream with the proce@@ eds from their bicycle shop ; not a single person on the wright brothers &apos; team had a college education , not even or@@ ville or wil@@ bu@@ r ; and the new york times followed them around nowhere .
and i love asking businesses , &quot; what &apos;s your con@@ version on new business ? &quot;
from the time tiv@@ o came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day , they are the single hig@@ he@@ st-@@ quality product on the market , hands down , there is no dis@@ pu@@ te .
in fact , some of his ideas were bad .
and it &apos;s those who start with &quot; why &quot; that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them .
they said , &quot; every day we have patients that come into the clinic -- child has an ear infe@@ ction , i prescri@@ be antibio@@ tics .
fort@@ y-@@ five years after gei@@ ger , health leads has to rein@@ vent the prescri@@ ption for basic resources .
do you have safe housing ? &quot;
so it &apos;s a bru@@ tal winter in the nor@@ the@@ ast , your kid has asth@@ ma , your heat just got turned off , and of course you &apos;re in the waiting room of the er , because the cold air trig@@ ger@@ ed your child &apos;s asth@@ ma .
so mi@@ a lo@@ z@@ ada is chief resi@@ dent of internal medicine at u@@ c@@ s@@ f medical center , but for three years as an under@@ graduate she was a health leads volunte@@ er in the clinic waiting room at boston medical center .
and most of all , i believe that when we measure healthcare , it will be , not by what the system was , but by what we chose it to be .
pi@@ racy is also very active in the stra@@ it of mal@@ ac@@ ca .
cre@@ w of four . sophisticated communications swe@@ ep .
why ? because the taliban with@@ held education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read .
here you see baseball players .
thank you .
watch it as it ro@@ tat@@ es back again . and this is a very bright audience , all right ? see if you can stop it from happening , even though you know 100 percent it &apos;s true that -- b@@ am ! you can &apos;t un@@ do it . what does that tell you about y@@ ourselves ? we &apos;re going to do it again . no doubt about it . see if you can stop it from happening . no . it &apos;s difficult .
well , there &apos;s analo@@ g and digital . thought that was appropriate here .
here you have the fertili@@ ty rate -- the number of children per woman -- and there you have the length of life in years .
we are looking down in the archi@@ ve , and when we are down into 18@@ 20 , there is only au@@ stri@@ a and sweden that can produce numbers .
about 195@@ 7 here , the health of the united states is the same as the phili@@ pp@@ ines .
we have to look over generations to understand it .
but it &apos;s not really that easy , that it &apos;s all a good story .
this family ear@@ ns about one dollar per day .
and these two young farmers , they are girls now -- because the parents are dead from hiv and aids -- they discuss with a trained agr@@ on@@ om@@ ist .
we have to know a little more about the world .
it was the government that made law function finally .
and remember , please remember my main message , which is this : the seem@@ ingly impossible is possible .
i met the last air force general who had actually shot down an enemy plane in com@@ bat .
we did it with 150 com@@ bat cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties in six weeks .
but we have trouble ac@@ cess@@ ing our outcomes .
i &apos;m going to dist@@ ingu@@ ish between what i call front half and back half .
we should have had 25@@ 0,000 tro@@ ops stre@@ aming into iraq on the he@@ els of that levi@@ athan s@@ wee@@ ping towards bag@@ h@@ dad .
this is why it matters to the military .
i used to give this brief inside the p@@ ent@@ ag@@ on in the early 1990s .
we connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time del@@ ay .
but here &apos;s the promise you make to the american public , to your own people , to the world .
but ultimately you &apos;re going to civili@@ ani@@ ze it , probably two thirds .
bom@@ bers , figh@@ ters go over here .
in this bra@@ c@@ ingly honest talk , international security strateg@@ ist thomas bar@@ nett out@@ lines a post-@@ cold war solution for the fo@@ under@@ ing u.s. military that is both sensi@@ ble and brea@@ th@@ taking in its simplicity : break it in two .
the problem is absolutely solu@@ ble , and even solu@@ ble in a way that &apos;s reas@@ on@@ ably cheap .
here &apos;s mo@@ unt pin@@ atu@@ bo in the early &apos; 90s . that put a whole bunch of sul@@ fur in the strat@@ o@@ sphere with a sort of atom@@ ic bom@@ b@@ -like cloud .
this topic is also old .
i &apos;ll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
because we have no way to agree about where to set the kno@@ bs .
you might argue about the san@@ ity of it , but the leverage is real .
i &apos;ll leave you with three questions , and then one final quote .
dr. edi@@ th wid@@ der -- she &apos;s now at the ocean research and conservation association -- was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here on the screen .
b@@ ing@@ o ! now i &apos;m told that &apos;s not just a squ@@ id phenomenon with males , but i don &apos;t know .
just an amazing animal , it can change color and tex@@ ture to match the surro@@ und@@ ings . watch him bl@@ end right into this al@@ ga@@ e .
we like our suffering because it &apos;s so good when it ce@@ ases for a while . &quot;
if i had to hear it 24 hours , non-@@ stop , it might be very ti@@ ring .
we think that if we could gather this and that , all the conditions , something that we say , &quot; everything to be happy -- to have everything to be happy . &quot;
just the m@@ ere fact of doing that fil@@ ls such a sense of ade@@ qu@@ ation with our deep nature .
another way is to try to find a general anti@@ do@@ te to all emotions , and that &apos;s by looking at the very nature .
they do , like , three years &apos; re@@ treat , where they do medi@@ tate 12 hours a day .
but they found that -- this is after three and a half hours in an f@@ mri , it &apos;s like coming out of a space ship .
we can &apos;t over@@ estimate the amount of des@@ pair that we are gener@@ ating with places like this .
so how is that being accompli@@ shed here ?
and every year they fail to because they don &apos;t want to hurt i.@@ m. pe@@ i &apos;s feelings .
